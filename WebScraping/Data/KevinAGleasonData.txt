		Related Articles Algorithm

		 I am skilled when it comes to general flow of logic in coding. If given a problem I can usually figure out some way to solve it. Learning the intricacies of a language comes with time, and the more I code the more concise my code becomes.

		 This is an example of one of my early JavaScript algorithms. I was asked if there was some way I could display related articles at the bottom of a page. Since the web host was restrictive and provided no way of achieving that, I set off to hack away in JavaScript and along came this project.

		 It finds related articles prioritizing as follows:  Similar Title Elements > Same Tags > Same Category > Same Author > Random  The findRandom function is rarely called since other elements usually pick up enough similarities, however script will fail in certain situations without it.

			Sample Title and Tags from The Torch: 

				Saint of the Issue: Nicholas of Myra
				Topical · Infante · Dec2013
				Generate New Article

		Advanced Knowledge of CSS

		 I understand the capability and power of advanced CSS, but also know that too many style animations can slow the rendering of a web page.

		 The following animation was created one late night once I finished updating The Torch website and had to wait for copy editing to complete.

		 It uses animations "spin-right", "spinX", and "spinY" to create a constant rotate, rotateX, and rotateY of 360deg on three absolutely positioned divs.

		jQuery UI Integration

		I began looking into JavaScript and jQuery libraries a short while ago. After seeing how simple they make some tasks, I have dedicated a good amount of time to learning their useful commands.

		Basketball and soccer are some of my favorite sports. I was captain of both in high school, missing All-Ohio by one spot, a mere few votes, for soccer. Naturally when I saw some of the user interaction capabilities of jQuery, my mind wandered to sports and entertainment.

		jQuery UI has some very neat user interaction capabilities, and the more I see what is possible the more my mind wanders into creating small unique ideas. I used the droppable functions to create this simple basketball interface.

		The Torch Section Headlines

		 I owe my love of web design to a Boston College campus publication, The Torch. This newspaper was just beginning and needed a web manager so I offered my assistance, telling them I did not have much skill, but would learn all I could to help if nobody else offered. Sure enough, no one did.

		The Torch site is run through a German webhost, Jimdo, which does not allow FTP access. Most of my work had to be done through HTML & CSS, until I found small workarounds such as linking iframes and scripts to code I saved in public folders on dropbox.

		 This is one of the first HTML and CSS codes I wrote. Its purpose is for the home page, to show the featured articles of the month.
