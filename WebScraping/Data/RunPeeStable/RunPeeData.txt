 Blended 

 <<<Return to movie list   

PeeTimes for:  Blended    Notes about these Peetimes:  I would recommend the 1st Peetime. it doesn't have any plot or character development and if you don't make it back in the allotted time you still won't miss anything important.  PeeTime 1 of 2  41  minutes into movie =  4  minute Peetime

 X-Men: Days Of Future Past 

 <<<Return to movie list   

PeeTimes for:  X-Men: Days Of Future Past    Notes about these Peetimes:  I'd recommend the 3rd Peetime.  

I went to spectacular effort to make sure all the Peetimes had as little of Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman's) scenes since I know that he, and everyone else, would be disappointed to miss any of his screen time. The Peetimes generally come at the expense of Dr. Trask's (Peter Dinklage) scenes, which generally involve long exposition that is easy to sum up. 

#1 The 1st 3 minutes of this Peetime are perfect - all silent exposition. But the last minute introduces a new character. 

#2 is a good Peetime and ends as a fight scene starts. 

#3 is mostly a scene of Trask talking about Mutants. 

#4 is decent but has a somewhat iconic scene right in the middle.  PeeTime 1 of 4  36  minutes into movie =  3  minute Peetime

 Godzilla 

 <<<Return to movie list   

PeeTimes for:  Godzilla    Notes about these Peetimes:  Any of the first 3 Peetimes are good but the 3rd is best. 

#1 is good and only has a few short bits of plot development that's easy to sum up. 

#2 is good, but there is some plot development with the MUTO. 

#3 is best because there is very little action or plot development. 

#4 is more for emergencies only; it begins the climax of the film and you'll miss the halo jump.  PeeTime 1 of 4  47  minutes into movie =  4  minute Peetime

 The Amazing Spider-Man 2 

 <<<Return to movie list   

PeeTimes for:  The Amazing Spider-Man 2    Notes about these Peetimes:  All 4 Peetimes are good and they're all about the same length. I would recommend using the 3rd Peetime if your bladder gives you a choice. 

1st Peetime: a long scene with Peter and Harry catching up. 

2nd Peetime: almost all exposition that is easy to sum up. 

3rd Peetime: a long dramatic scene between Peter and Aunt May talking about Peter's parents. It's well acted but I don't think anyone's going to see this movie for the acting.

The 2nd Peetime is a long sequence of Steve and Natasha searching for a hidden base. There's no plot or character development during this scene. However, there's a big reveal after this Peetime so don't be late.

 Jinn 

 <<<Return to movie list   

PeeTimes for:  Jinn    Notes about these Peetimes:  Due to the brevity of the movie there's only one peetime. Fortunately it's all one long scene so it's fairly easy to sum up.  PeeTime 1 of 1  36  minutes into movie =  4  minute Peetime

 <<<Return to movie list   

PeeTimes for:  Noah    Notes about these Peetimes:  I think the first two Peetimes are best. Use one of those if you can.

 <<<Return to movie list

 Divergent 

 <<<Return to movie list   

PeeTimes for:  Divergent    Notes about these Peetimes:  The 1st Peetime is the best because there is no plot and very little action. 

If you're NOT interested in seeing Theo James without his shirt, or he and Shailene Woodley kiss, then the 2nd Peetime is good. 

The 3rd is definitely for emergencies only. The Peetime ends with some important development/action, but it's the last moment to go before the movie ends.  PeeTime 1 of 3  56  minutes into movie =  4  minute Peetime

 Need For Speed 

 <<<Return to movie list   

PeeTimes for:  Need For Speed    Notes about these Peetimes:  In my opinion the 2nd Peetime is best, if you hurry! 

The 1st Peetime jumps right into some action. 

The 2nd Peetime has about 2 minutes of lite action before it picks up again. This is the best time to RUN to the restroom. You should make it back before the action really gets going again. 

The movie was a non-stop adrenaline ride. Both Peetimes include cool racing scenes, each have awesome displays of a Ford Mustangs ability to inspire awe. No matter when you decide to get up, I can promise that you're going to miss something cool. I just tried to minimize the awesomeness that you'll miss. 

FYI, personally I would recommend NOT seeing this movie in 3D. There were only two scenes that I could even tell were shot in 3D, I don't think it was enough to make up for the ticket price difference. But it was an awesome movie. :-)  PeeTime 1 of 2  41  minutes into movie =  4  minute Peetime

PeeTimes for:  Veronica Mars    Notes about these Peetimes:  Both Peetimes are okay, but not great.

PeeTimes for:  Son Of God    Notes about these Peetimes:  All of the Peetimes are pretty good. I tried my best to chose Peetimes that had only brief scenes of Jesus. 

The 1st Peetime is mostly about the Jews protesting Roman occupation. It ends with Jesus entering Jerusalem and going to the tomb of Lazarus. 

The 2nd Peetime is the longest. It has 6 very short scenes, mostly involving Pilate and the High Priest and how they'll deal with Jesus and the protests.
