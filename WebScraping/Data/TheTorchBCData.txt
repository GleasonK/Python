        Alpha Sigma Nu Holds Panel Discussion on Jesuit Education After Graduation - The Torch BC

            Alpha Sigma Nu Holds Panel Discussion on Jesuit Education After Graduation        

Campus · Apr2014 · Johnson

    by Stephanie Johnson

     

    On April 2, the Boston College chapter of Alpha Sigma Nu, the honor society for Jesuit colleges and universities, held its flagship event of the spring semester. A panel discussion on the role of
    a Jesuit education after graduation took place in Higgins 310. The event was organized by the current officers and facilitated by Fr. Gregory Kalscheur, Alpha Sigma Nu’s faculty advisor. The
    panel was comprised of six panelists including Ashley Duggan, Associate Professor of Communication; Fr. James Keenan S.J., Professor of Theology and Director of the Presidential Scholars Program;
    Fr. Richard McGowan S.J., Adjunct Professor of Finance and Economics; Tim Muldoon, Assistant to the Vice President for University Mission and Ministry; Tim Mulvey, Assistant Director of the
    Center for Student Formation; and Fr. James Weiss, Associate Professor of Theology.

    Together the panelists aimed to answer how one continues to live according to the values of a Jesuit education. Tim Muldoon was the first panelist to address the juniors and seniors in
    attendance. He suggested that we see ourselves carrying on something started long ago by St. Ignatius. Ignatian spirituality provides us with the confidence needed to discover what it means to be
    a human being. Muldoon recommended that the members of Alpha Sigma Nu continue to ask themselves, “What is it that God made us for?” The Boston College faculty “cares about what kind of human
    beings you become.” Finally he stated that a Jesuit education has ultimately given us a lifelong appreciation for what is worth loving.

     

    Next, Tim Mulvey presented the audience with an experience of his own which enabled him to recognize the value of a Jesuit education. He ultimately found it in the midst of failure. After two
    years of teaching through a program in Tennessee, he realized that he hated teaching. It simply was not what he was meant to do. That was when his Jesuit education came to the rescue. He utilized
    the three “be’s” to discern what he was truly meant to do: be attentive, be reflective, be loving. What he learned at Boston College ended up helping him through a very tough time in his life. He
    recommended that the audience use the three “be’s” when experiencing failure.

     

    Ashley Duggan spoke next, and she reflected on her time as a professor at Boston College. She suggested that BC is “a place to step back and look at the long road, find integration in unexpected
    ways, and discover the hidden meaning in life.” We must ask ourselves how our education plays a role in our everyday decisions.

     

    Fr. Keenan followed Duggan with a few words on vocation. He stated, “As members of the Society of Jesus, we each have our own vocation; that’s what we believe about students, too.” He claimed
    that Jesuit education is about faith, social values, excellence, and realizing our own vocations. We are not all invited to be the same person. It is important that we each become who we are
    called to be. Our Jesuit education allows us to pursue our vocations in life. He concluded by stating, “We are all made in the image of God, but we are made differently.”

     

    Next Fr. McGowan offered a management perspective. He told the audience, “One thing to take out of stats is how to take a risk.” Our Jesuit education teaches us that risk has two elements: danger
    and adventure. His hope is that the ideal Jesuit graduate has learned to want to take risks and seek out adventure.

     

    Finally Fr. Weiss reflected on the results of two Jesuit educations in his life. He focused largely on the transition of Jesuit education throughout the past 40 years. He claimed that a lot of
    what we call Jesuit is not specific to Jesuits but rather is common amongst Catholics. Since 1975, Jesuit education has become associated with social justice, the practice of reflection, and
    discernment. According to Fr. Jim Weiss, “the subject of what is distinctively Jesuit remains unclear.”

     

    The panel concluded with a question and answer session involving the members of Alpha Sigma Nu in attendance.

            Father Scott Brodeur Discusses St. Paul’s Teachings on Charisms        

Campus · Apr2014 · Shely

    by Allison R. Shely

     

    On Thursday, April 10, Father Scott Brodeur, S.J., a professor at the Gregorian University in Rome, gave a lecture entitled “What St. Paul Teaches Us About Charisms.” Held in the Heights Room, the talk was co-sponsored by the Center for Ignatian Spirituality, the Roche Center for Catholic Education, and the School of Theology and Ministry. In the
    beginning, Father Brodeur admitted that a “formidable topic” was at hand. First, he defined some terms and presented their etymological background. The Greek chárisma appears 17 times in the New
    Testament: 16 in Paul’s letters and once in First Peter. Deriving from cháris, grace, chárisma means “something given out of generosity” or “gracious gift,” which is Father Brodeur’s preferred
    translation. The New American Bible translates chárisma as “a gift” and other translations render it as “a free gift,” but Father Brodeur called this problematic, for the term cannot apply to
    gifts given by humans to humans and “clearly [refers to] a divine activity.” Moreover, natural talents and fortunate circumstances are natural, not spiritual gifts.

     

    References to “gracious gifts” appear in five Pauline letters: First and Second Corinthians, First and Second Timothy, and Romans. While a disciple of Paul wrote First and Second Timothy, the
    other three letters are “authentically Pauline,” written by the Apostle to the Gentiles himself.

     

    Father Brodeur chose to focus on chapter 12 of First Corinthians, where the term chárisma appears seven times. Only here does Paul explain the link between the Holy Spirit and charisms. Paul’s
    other focus was on the diversity of gifts that come from the one Lord. This was in response to divisions that had developed in the Church at Corinth. Paul, writing from Ephesus, knew the Church
    extremely well. The Corinthian Christians shared the “consumer values” of other citizens of their prosperous city and had turned the celebration of the Eucharist into an occasion to outdo each
    other. Their preferred method was to speak in tongues or prophesy, disrupting the service and directing the focus to themselves. Paul sought to put these two gifts into their “broader liturgical
    and theological contexts.” When listing the charisms distributed by the Spirit—wisdom, knowledge, the faith that leads to miracles, healing, and miraculous powers and exorcisms—Paul put prophecy
    and speaking in tongues, along with the complementary charisms for their interpretation, at the end. Paul warned the Corinthians that prophecy and tongues would cease, but faith, hope, and love,
    the greatest of the three, will last. The Spirit acts freely for the benefit of the community and no disunity can originate from God.

     

    Father Brodeur concluded that the diversity of charisms reveals the “superabundance of divine life that God chooses to communicate to the followers of Jesus through the activity of the Holy
    Spirit.” These gifts are to draw Christians towards greater love and for use in the service of love. “God treats us, His adopted sons and daughters, as adults,” said Father Brodeur. Through these
    gifts, the Spirit even now is “transforming us into a New Creation” that will be perfected on the last day. Confident that God is always at work renewing the Church, members of religious orders
    are called to rediscover the charisms of their founders, though not only religious receive charisms. As for American Catholics, they must remember faith, hope, and love.

        Fr. McNellis Speaks on the Importance of Men of Good Character - The Torch BC

            Fr. McNellis Speaks on the Importance of Men of Good Character        

Campus · Luedeking · Apr2014

    by Alessandra Luedeking

     

    On Thursday evening, April 3, students filled the lecture-style classroom in McGuinn in anticipation of Fr. Paul McNellis’s talk, “How Men Become Good Leaders (And Why Women Should Care).” The
    event was organized by the Sons of St. Patrick and the St. Thomas More Society, both Catholic, student-run groups on campus. The talk centered on the importance of men of good character as the
    basis for respectable leaders.

    Fr. McNellis opened with daunting statistics concerning the desire and marketability of a good, charismatic leader.

     

    “Leadership is the thing; everyone is interested,” he said.

     

    US companies spend a formidable amount of money annually on leadership development: approximately $14 billion. Boston College itself offers more than 20 leadership programs and more than a dozen
    leadership awards. The stereotypical characteristics associated with leadership include wisdom, self-confidence, success, and inspiration. While admirable, these qualities in and of themselves do
    not beget a leader.

     

    “A leader is someone we’re willing to follow because we respect him,” Fr. McNellis said. “We don’t insist that someone follow us because we’re the leader. Someone with authority can command us
    and we must obey, or face the consequences, but they cannot command us to want to follow them.”

     

    To achieve this elusive quality, Fr. McNellis went on to say, men must develop good characters. He shared instances in his life where he had witnessed men display the strong character that
    typifies good leaders. The importance of the stories was to convey that neither of the men had trained for the situations that demanded their immediate attention. Their impulsive actions stemmed
    rather from their strong, good characters, and resulted in acts of courage that evoked respect and admiration from nearby spectators.

     

    “Men become good leaders by first becoming good men,” Fr. McNellis said. How does one become a good man? Fr. McNellis offered a few pointers:

     

    “Be honest, a man of your word; do what you say you’ll do; never lie or cheat for any reason; develop a sense of honor; treat all women with respect, whether they ask for it or not; always finish
    what you start; accept responsibility; and don’t walk around the question of God. Be man enough to address it.”

     

    Fr. McNellis went on to acknowledge that contemporary society discourages virtue and commitment in men. “[Society] disparages manly virtues and often denies that there even is such a thing.” The
    divorce, hookup, and drinking cultures all induce what he labeled as the “Peter Pan Syndrome,” producing men who “don’t grow up and are afraid of marriage.”

     

    Next, Fr. McNellis enumerated the three perils encumbering men of good characters. The first and most insidious of these is “thinking of college as a bubble that puts real life on hold.” The
    college experience is as much a part of the real world as the lives students carve for themselves upon graduation. The second danger is the pervasive alcohol culture. “Alcohol addiction puts
    emotional development on hold, which must be resumed in sobriety and recovery,” Fr. McNellis warned. He rejected the belief that “it’s not alcoholism until after graduation.”

     

    The last of these obstacles is pornography. He revealed that the brain’s chemical reaction to viewing it is similar to that triggered by heavy doses of cocaine and heroin. Pornography is so
    widespread that researchers conducting porn experiments could not come up with a control group. Instead, they were forced to use men recovering from porn addiction.

     

    Fr. McNellis concluded his talk by reading a letter written by Commander John Shea, a BC graduate in 1918, to his son, John Richard Shea (’58) during World War II. The heartwarming letter,
    written when John Richard was only five years old, exemplified the qualities of a good father, imparting love and advice to his son, in the likelihood that the war would leave him without a
    father. Two months after mailing the letter, Commander John died in a bombing rescue mission.

     

    “To be a good father will take all the virtues and will be the most challenging task you’ll ever have in life. If you fail at it, it’ll be the most bitter disappointment you’ll have in life,” Fr.
    McNellis claimed. “If at the end of your life you know you have been a good father, it will be the most satisfying thing you will have done, the only thing of lasting satisfaction, and you will
    be ready for death at that point.”

     

    In his parting words, Fr. McNellis stressed that the quest to cultivate a strong character is one that “requires a serious approach to life and one that can’t wait until you graduate.”

            Rowan Williams Speaks on “Revelation in the Context of Interreligious Dialogue”        

Campus · Borders · Apr2014

    by Margo Borders

     

    On Monday, April 7, the Church in the 21st Century and the BC Theology Department hosted Rowan Williams, Emeritus Archbishop of Canterbury and Professor of Theology at Cambridge University.
    Williams gave a lecture entitled, “Revelation in the Context of Interreligious Dialogue” as a part of an annual lecture series on topics of interreligious dialogue.

    Williams first introduced the definition of divine revelation as “God being active.” He challenged this definition, however, because it is not a helpful paradigm. When thinking of divine
    revelation as divine action, it is a paradox to speak of a God who reveals Himself because of the contradiction between a deterministic and free God. A God who acts out of freedom is a God who
    cannot be contained. This definition also leads to the idea that other faiths, especially non-Abrahamic traditions, are limited by human achievement.

     

    Williams then spoke about divine action in Abrahamic traditions. The action of God in the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions is unlike human action because there is no gap between action
    and circumstances. Williams pointed out three points that emerge from this idea. The first is that divine act is the eternal enactment of divine being. It expresses what it is to be God. The
    second is that divine action is never reactive or triggered into being. Divine action is free, but not arbitrary. The last point is that God’s actions are always self-consistent. Because God is a
    covenantal God, He can be relied upon. These points give us clues about thinking anew about divine action and the context of revelation and interfaith dialogue.

     

    Next, Williams spoke about the divine action of Jesus. Revealed in Jesus is a God who does not hold back divine love in its radical fullness. Jesus’ salvific gifts are not conditional upon human
    achievement. Jesus’ actions are encountered in and through relations of self-disposition. In our own struggles of being selfless, we can align ourselves with this God who revealed Himself through
    Jesus’ selflessness on Calvary. Jesus’ revelation of God does not reveal pieces of information, but rather habits or actions that show us how to find God revealed in the world. We can learn how
    to be a disciple.

     

    Williams then focused on the interreligious encounter. He said that dialogue begins in the moment when the Christian invites their conversation partner to think about habits and how they manifest
    themselves in their life. The Christian seems to say, “this what we’ve learned through the habits in you, and we would like to know how you have learned and cultivated these habits.” Williams
    suggested that to believe in a God revealed in Jesus is to believe that meaning is found in all things looking towards God, and cannot be exhausted.

     

    Williams argues that open religious dialogue is a mark of confidence instead of weakness of faith. A person who is willing to be open to dialogue is certain that what is embodied in Jesus cannot
    be contained and can be found in all people. We cannot think that the endeavor of dialogue will bring us further from Christ or his teachings. Ones who believe and are confident will engage in
    dialogue because what they believe cannot be superseded or relativized.

     

    When asked if he wants everyone to be Christian, Williams responds, “No, I want everyone to know the person of Jesus Christ as the incarnation of the Eternal Word.” Williams suggested throughout
    his lecture that one’s own faith will continue to be renewed through dialogue. Revelation continues to happen because we are revealed to ourselves in dialogue, as well as God. Williams’ call to
    action was to approach other faiths with eagerness.

     

    “The very act of dialogue is a potent and unambiguous witnesses we can bear to Jesus,” Williams said.

     

    Williams acknowledged that this idea of faith and openness to dialogue is a paradox, but not an impossible one. He ended the lecture by saying that wherever we go, an act of Jesus Christ waits
    for us. We should expect the unexpected in these encounters, as we do with a God who cannot be contained.

        Theology and Ministry Library Exhibits Pre-Vatican II Pamphlets and Religious Articles - The Torch BC

            Theology and Ministry Library Exhibits Pre-Vatican II Pamphlets and Religious Articles        

Campus · Antonio · Apr2014

    by Margaret Antonio

     

    In 1978, William J. Leonard, a Jesuit theology professor at Boston College, began collecting thousands of pamphlets and religious articles about Catholic teaching, liturgy, and lifestyle before
    the introduction of the Second Vatican Council’s reforms. Fr. Leonard realized that the “implementation of Vatican II reforms would result in an overhaul of the literature and material culture of
    Catholic religious life.” His collections began the Liturgy & Life Collection at the John J. Burns Library.

    An ongoing exhibit at the Theology and Ministry Library, If Heaven Be Your Destiny! The World of American Catholicism, 1945 – 1965, highlights a microcosm of the original Burns
    Library collection. The exhibit is an initiative of Dean Mark Massa, S.J. of the Theology and Ministry School along with Bridget Burke, Associate University Librarian for Digital Initiatives and
    Public Programs, and Esther A. Griswold, Head Librarian of the Theology and Ministry Library.

     

    “We were interested in bringing materials in the Burns’ Liturgy & Life Collection to wider attention,” said Ms. Griswold.

     

    Dean Massa, S.J., a historian of American Catholicism, also wanted to address the issue that many young Catholics are unaware of the past. As introduced at the beginning of the exhibit, “the
    collection seeks to introduce younger Catholics and others to a world of religious piety and worship now lost, or at least less familiar than the one that has defined the U.S. Catholic community
    of the past half century.” As the title of the exhibit, If Heaven Be Your Destiny, suggests, it draws on the sense that most Catholics believed heaven was their destiny and privilege.

     

    The exhibit displays enlarged copies of typical pamphlets that would be found in the bookracks at the entrance of a church as well as religious statues and devotional articles that would be found
    in a typical Catholic home. One pamphlet, entitled “Family Holy Hour: Nightly Adoration in the Home” recalls how it was once common that Catholic families would regularly pray the rosary together
    every night.

     

    The curators of the exhibit inserted brief descriptions of the devotions and traditions referenced by the displayed pamphlets and religious articles. For example, one describes the meaning of
    Eucharistic adoration and how articles and booklets offered guidance for individuals who wished to engage in such devotions. Religious devotions, such as Eucharistic adoration and the rosary, are
    still present in the lives of Catholics today, but not as avidly promoted or practiced as in the pre-Vatican II print articles and the audiences whom they reached.

     

    Other objects displayed referred to common perspectives on the contemporary changes in the practice of Catholicism. One of the major changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council was the
    celebration of the Liturgy. The cover of one pamphlet questions, “Has the New Liturgy Killed Personal Piety?” Nearby, other booklets offer instructions about the changes.

     

    The exhibit not only documents changes in religious devotion, but also in the social life of contemporary Catholics. A workbook entitled, “Instructions on Dating for High School Boys” stands
    alongside others offering guidelines and commentaries on sex education and modesty.

     

    Publishing companies, such as Our Sunday Visitor, The Queen’s Work, and Ligourian, sought to offer texts for Catholics to deepen their faith, develop their own devotional
    emphases, and arm themselves for argument with those who criticized the Church,” reads one of several commentaries in the exhibit. Churches typically displayed such print literature on a bookrack
    near the entrance so parishioners could choose a topic of entrance and buy the pamphlet for typically no more than 25 cents.

     

    The objects displayed were chosen from representative categories from the original collection of pre-Vatican II articles in the Burns Library,” said Griswold. By representing a subset of the
    original collection, the curators hoped to stimulate interest in academic work as well. The 1945-1965 exhibit fits into the broader setting of American print culture, as comics, magazines,
    newspapers, and television also sought to depict American life and perspectives. Thus, the Liturgy and Life Exhibit plays an important role in preserving a piece of American culture.

     

    Fr. Leonard’s vision to document “disappearing Catholic practices” has expanded exponentially since its inception. Today, the collection includes about 30,000 volumes and “is considered to be the
    most comprehensive archive in America on the pre-Vatican Catholic Church.”

     

    The Theology and Ministry Library exhibit, If Heaven Be Your Destiny! The World of American Catholicism, 1945 – 1965, will continue until June 1, 2014. The original archives can be
    accessed at the Burns Library. To access the digital Liturgy & Life Collection, visit tinyurl.com/LiturgyandLife.

        Popes John Paul II, John XXIII Canonized on Divine Mercy Sunday - The Torch BC

            Popes John Paul II, John XXIII Canonized on Divine Mercy Sunday        

World · Evangjeli · Lead · Apr2014

    by Gjergji Evangjeli

     

    On the Sunday after Easter, Divine Mercy Sunday, the Church celebrated the canonizations of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II, two of the most influential popes of the 20th century and among
    the most important figures in the last one hundred years. It was Pope John Paul II who instituted the celebration of the Divine Mercy on the Sunday following Easter.

    Vatican Radio estimates that the crowds in attendance for the Canonization Mass were about 800,000 in and around St. Peter’s Square with another 500,000 watching
    from big screens set up throughout Rome, as well as millions on TVs and computer screens throughout the world. Among those gathered in Rome, the white and red flags of Poland were ever prominent,
    reflecting the deep love of the Polish people for the first Polish Pope to be declared a Saint. Pilgrims started gathering in St. Peter’s Square from dawn.

     

    Another historic feature of this occasion was the presence of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI alongside Pope Francis, making this the occasion where two pontiffs were present at the canonization of
    two other pontiffs. Benedict sat with his brother Cardinals and Bishops and was received with applause as he took his seat.

     

    For his homily on this occasion, Pope Francis spoke on the importance of the wounds of Christ, which were mentioned in the day’s Gospel reading. Following His Resurrection, Christ appeared to His
    Apostles, but Thomas was not among them. Being incredulous of the news the others delivered to him, St. Thomas remarked that he would not believe Jesus had come back form the dead unless he saw
    the mark of the nails and the pierced side of the Redeemer. Remarking on this, the Pope said, “The wounds of Jesus are a scandal, a stumbling block for faith, yet they are also the test of faith.
    That is why, on the body of the risen Christ, the wounds never pass away: they remain, for those wounds are the enduring sign of God's love for us. They are essential for believing in God. Not
    for believing that God exists, but for believing that God is love, mercy and faithfulness.”

     

    John XXIII and John Paul II, the Pope said, were “priests, bishops and popes of the twentieth century. [They] lived through the tragic events of that century, but they were not overwhelmed by
    them. For them, God was more powerful; faith was more powerful—faith in Jesus Christ the Redeemer of man and the Lord of history; the mercy of God, shown by those five wounds, was more powerful;
    and more powerful too was the closeness of Mary, our Mother.”

     

    As part of the celebration of their sainthood, a vial of blood from St. John Paul II and a piece of skin from St. John XXIII were presented and placed beside the altar. Following the Eucharistic
    prayer, their names were included in the Litany of the Saints for the first time.

     

    St. John Paul II’s canonization process is the quickest in modern times, and a certain sense of holy urgency was marked by the fact that then-Pope Benedict XVI waived the normal five year wait
    period required for his beatification following chants at the pontiff’s funeral Mass of “Santo subito” in Italian, or “Saint immediately” by the crowds.

     

    Delegations from more than 100 countries were present for the proceedings, including 24 heads of state. A large Jewish delegation was also present, witnessing to the great closeness of
    Jewish-Christian relations under the guidance of these two Popes.

     

    John XXIII (1881-1963), born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, was the fourth child of fourteen born to a family of sharecroppers in a village of Lombardy in Italy. He was sent away to study for the
    priesthood at age 11 and was created Cardinal-Priest and Patriarch of Venice on January 12, 1953 by Pope Pius XII. He is affectionately known as “il Papa Buono” in Italian, or “the Good Pope.”
    After convening the Second Vatican Council, Pope John XXIII died on June 3, 1963. On July 5, 2013, Pope Francis waved the traditional requirement for a second miracle on account of his convening
    Vatican II and approved his cause for canonization.

     

    John Paul II (1920-2005), born Karol Josef Wojtyla, was the youngest of three children born to Karol Wojtyla and Emilia Kakzorowska in the Polish town of Wadowice. His mother died when he was
    only eight years old, and by the time he was twenty, he had lost everyone in his immediate family. His early life was defined by the presence of both the Nazis and the Communists in Poland, both
    groups from whom he escaped punishment very narrowly. On October 16, 1978, the then-Cardinal Archbishop of Krakow was chosen to be the next Pope, the first non-Italian Pope since 1523. Pope John
    Paul II was easily one of the most recognizable personalities in the 20th century, and among his many other accomplishments, bears a major part of the responsibility for toppling the Communist
    regime in Eastern Europe.

        Colorado Legislature Abandons Pro-Abortion Bill - The Torch BC

            Colorado Legislature Abandons Pro-Abortion Bill        

World · Apr2014 · Marsland

    by Alex Marsland

     

    On April 16th, amidst strong pro-life opposition and declining popular support, Colorado Senate Democrats backed off from a controversial bill that would effectively prevent any regulations
    concerning abortion.

     

    The bill in question (SB 175) came under heavy criticism from Republicans and pro-life advocates for being both overly ambiguous and wide ranging. Sen. Bernie Herpin, (R-Colorado Springs), for
    example, pointed to the fact that the bill was reactionary and paranoid in sentiment: "It's a solution in search of a problem… There is no one, no evidence that has said there's a denial of
    things like contraception to women in Colorado."

    The biggest issue of SB 175, as expressed by Colorado Republicans, is the vague terminology regarding “reproductive health care” and in what cases regulations
    could be imposed. One section reads that the "state, its agencies, institutions, political subdivisions and units of local government shall not enact a policy regarding reproductive health care
    that is inconsistent with or interferes with access to information based on current evidence based scientific data and medical consensus." This bill would not only prevent democratic opposition
    to abortion, but could come at the cost of common sense regulations for women’s safety.

     

    The wide ranging nature of the bill sparked much concern among pro-life voters and advocates. Denver Archbishop Samuel Aquila helped publicized the issues of SB 175, and his leadership formed the
    greatest opposition to it. He remarked that the bill was “both ambiguous and extremely dangerous,” and, to a crowd of hundreds attending the assembly and prayer vigil, drew attention to its
    undemocratic nature: "Coloradans are not against common sense regulations on abortions, and they should have the opportunity to be able to debate and pass those regulations."

     

    The Archbishop of Denver highlighted the importance of the Catholic voice in the political process, "Too many times we have taken a back seat. Catholics, Christians and people of good will can no
    longer take a back seat. We are called to work for the good and for the true." This has been a position invoked recently by Pope Francis, who, at a meeting with Italy's Pro-Life Movement remarked
    upon the importance of defending innocent life, "It is necessary to reiterate the strongest opposition to any direct attack on life, especially innocent and defenseless life, and the unborn child
    in the womb is the archetype (antonomasia) of innocence."

     

    Perhaps indicating a connection with the Pope’s words, Archbishop Aquila published an open letter which called upon the faithful to call their senators, contact the media and pray to defeat the
    bill, opposition to SB 175 grew quickly. In addition to the public assembly and prayer vigil, citizens expressed their views in more overtly political ways. In Senator David Balmer’s case, this
    included 100 calls to his office and 1,400 e-mails to stop the bill. Republican Senator Owen Hill said an online petition he posted in opposition to SB 175 gathered 5,000 signatures in just 10
    hours.

     

    Under such public pressure, Sen. Andy Kerr, D-Lakewood withdrew the bill he had sponsored, citing the possibility that “D.C.-style politics,” such as filibustering, “were going to be happening in
    the last three weeks of session here.” The withdrawal of the bill could also have been affected by the indecision of Sen. John Kefalas, D-Fort Collins, who did not know if the bill was worth the
    public outcry, and whose absence on April 15th delayed the voting for a day.

     

    The Archbishop expressed his thanks to the faithful via a tweet on April 17th: “Lift up your hearts in gratitude to God, SB 175 died today. Blessings on everyone who prayed & contacted
    legislators! Stay involved!”

     

    The Colorado Catholic Conference joined in appreciation: “It was your witness that made it possible to kill this horrible piece of legislation. It is because of your willingness to engage the
    public square that we were able to defeat SB 175.”

        New Vatican Commission Will Advocate for Children’s Welfare - The Torch BC

            New Vatican Commission Will Advocate for Children’s Welfare        

World · Apr2014 · Steiner

    by Libbie Steiner

     

    The Vatican has released the names of eight people appointed to the newly created Commission for the Protection of Minors. The members of the Commission include many laypeople and women from
    different professions and backgrounds, representing a notable departure from the largely clerical makeup of many other Vatican advising bodies. The aim of the new Commission will be first to
    address the remaining problems in the Church concerning child sexual abuse by priests and then to expand that role to address any problem of child welfare in the wider world.

    The Commission for the Protection of Minors is expected to play a significant role in advising Pope Francis as well as other Vatican Commissions and Congregations
    on any issues surrounding child sexual abuse within the Church and the protection of children across the world. Many countries have just begun to enact policies of child protection, and the
    Church in establishing this new Commission is trying to tell the world that it cares about child welfare and will serve an educative function for the rest of the world. Monsignor Stephen
    Rossetti, a psychiatrist with expertise in the relationship between psychological and spiritual health in the priesthood, says that he hopes the role of the Commission will grow wider quickly: “I
    believe that the Church… needs to be the vocal voice of the children and the protection of children. Jesus is very clear about that: ‘Let the children come unto me.’ The Kingdom belongs to the
    children.”

     

    The makeup of the Commission has won high praise from many, both within and outside the Church, in recent weeks. Half of the group of advisers are women, reflecting tangibly the Holy Father’s
    commitment to giving women a greater role in Church advisement and governance. One woman named the to the body, Marie Collins, is a victim of child sexual abuse herself and currently an outspoken
    child advocate. The appointment of a victim to this Commission marks a milestone in Church advocacy for victims of abuse and speaks volumes about the Holy Father’s dedication to the cause of
    child protection. Another notable selection is the appointment of Boston’s Cardinal Archbishop Sean O’Malley. He is the only American on the Commission and has been a strong proponent of the
    rights and welfare of children in the United States for many years. The Commission will be made of a very diverse group of both men and women, laity and clergy, in order to gain many different
    perspectives on child protection.

     

    The structure and specific agenda of the Commission for the Protection of Minors has not been officially set. Pope Francis has set up this Commission but left most decisions on how and for what
    purpose the Commission will function largely up to the members themselves. In this way, the people on the body will be able to decide the best way to have the Commission function in the most
    effective and helpful manner. The Holy Father has shown great commitment to the welfare of children by creating this new Commission even in this time of financial trouble and streamlining in the
    Vatican.

            UK and US Fetal Incineration Sparks Backlash Among Pro-Life Advocates and Health Officials        

World · Infante · Apr2014

    by Sofia Infante

     

    The recent discovery that the fetal remains of unborn babies were disposed of by incineration as clinical waste in hospitals across the United Kingdom and the United States has prompted outrage
    from pro-life advocates who say it reflects total disregard for the dignity of human life. According to an investigation launched by the UK’s Channel 4, the bodies of around 15,500 babies were
    burned as medical waste and used to heat some of the facilities. The investigation also revealed that 27 National Health Services (NHS) trusts had incinerated fetal remains in the last two years.
    A report by The Telegraph revealed that Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, one of the UK’s leading hospitals, had incinerated 797 miscarried or aborted fetuses at its on site “waste-to energy
    facility.” In another facility at Ipswich Hospital 1,001 fetal remains were brought in from another location. The facilities had told the mothers that their child’s body would be cremated.

    The recent discovery that an Oregon facility has been burning fetal tissue of aborted fetuses from British Columbia has prompted an Oregon County Commissioner to
    order that incinerators stop accepting boxed medical waste. According to CBS Portland affiliate KOIN-TV, it is unclear how long the facility had been disposing of fetal tissue because the medical
    waste is delivered in sealed boxes.

     

    Kristy Anderson, a British Columbia Health Ministry spokeswoman, said that regional health authorities in British Columbia have contract with a company that sends biomedical waste that includes,
    “human tissue, such as surgically removed cancerous tissue, amputated limbs, and fetal tissue.” British Columbia Catholic, a Catholic newspaper, identified the company as Marion, owned and
    operated by Covanta in a partnership with Marion County. The plant is believed to be the only one in Oregon generating energy from waste.

     

    The possibility that the plant is burning fetal tissue from other places has yet to be ruled out. When contacted by the AP, a Covanta Marion representative said he did not know whether the
    medical shipments included fetal tissue from Canada or elsewhere. Sam Brentano, chairman of the Marion County board of commissioners, apologized, stating, “We provide an important service to the
    people of this state and it would be a travesty if this program is jeopardized due to this finding…I'm sorry I didn't know that this included fetal tissue, but now that I do know, believe me,
    things will change.”

     

    According to County spokeswoman Jolene Kelly, commissioners were unaware that fetal tissue might be included as part of the medical waste and noted that the practice is a “disrespectful way to
    dispose of remains”. The county has scheduled an emergency hearing for Thursday to possibly rewrite an ordinance to clarify what is accepted as medical waste.

     

    Although the practice was largely restricted in the US, it is much more widespread in Britain where recent discoveries cornering the incineration of fetal tissue has been condemned by pro-life
    advocates like Carolyn Farrow, who stated, "We hope that this tragic and distressing story will cause the mask that exists to disguise the humanity of the unborn to slip, causing society to
    reflect more deeply on the value of human life and what it means to be human”. Farrow emphasized the importance of discussing the greater implications of expanding legal abortion, “We should not
    forget the almost 200,000 babies who are lost to abortion every year in the UK, almost all of whom will have had their remains treated in a similar fashion.”

     

    Pally Tully, general secretary of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, said the hospital practice is directly connected with legal abortion, “We must stop killing babies like these
    by abortion and then we will know how to respect the dead.”

     

    The practice has also been criticized by Health Officials who condemned the incineration of fetus and called for a suspension. UK Health Minister Dan Poulter condemned the practice as “totally
    unacceptable.” He noted, “While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue Authority has now been asked to
    ensure that it acts on this issue without delay.”

     

    NHS director Bruce Keogh said hospital should either cremate or bury the bodies of aborted or miscarried babies. Although the practice is not illegal in the UK, it is considered inappropriate.
    According to the BBC, Poulter has asked Keough to make sure hospitals stop incinerating fetal remains.

     

    Farrow praised the quick response by health officials but argued that the ban does not go far enough because private abortion clinics still dispose of fetal remains as “clinical waste alongside
    soiled dressings, gloves and equipment." "We would like to see abortion clinics be subject to similar regulations in terms of not only informing the parents as what will happen to their unborn
    children but also offering them a choice of dignified options as to what to do with their baby's remains."

            Pontifical Liturgies of Triduum and Easter        

World · Chin · Apr2014

    by Jay Chin

     

    The Easter Triduum is a three-day period of preparation for Easter, beginning on the evening of Maundy Thursday and concluding with Holy Saturday Vespers. Pope Francis began this year’s Triduum
    not at the Vatican, but at the Centro Santa Maria della Provvidenza di Roma, a rehabilitation center for the elderly and disabled. There he preached an off-the-cuff homily about Jesus’ Last
    Supper as a farewell, as a giving of an inheritance, and that part of that inheritance is being a servant, especially a servant of love to others. After the homily, he performed the Washing of
    Feet ritual with nine Italian men, a 16-year-old youth from Cape Verde, a Muslim from Lybia, and an Ethiopian woman. Pope Francis not only washed their feet, but also kissed them, sometimes
    bending all the way to the ground for those who were paralyzed. Going out to the less fortunate on Maundy Thursday is a personal tradition of His Holiness, going back to when he was Archbishop of
    Buenos Aires and it is clear that he intends to maintain it instead of celebrating Mass at the Cathedral of St. John Lateran, as was until recently customary.

    His Holiness presided at the Via Crucis, or the Way of the Cross, on the night of Good Friday, the only day of the year when the Mass is not celebrated. The
    meditations at each station were given by Arcbishop Giancarlo Maria Bregantini of Campobasso-Boiano. He called to mind those marginalized by society and those who suffer violence. A homily was
    offered by Father Raniero Cantalamessa, O.F.M. Cap., Preacher of the Papal Household since 1980, where he denounced the evils of greed and the importance of the Sacrament of Reconciliation. At
    the end of the Via Crucis, Pope Francis offered a reflection where he pointed out that the Cross shows both the “monstrosity of man, and also God’s mercy.” He also asked those present to remember
    those who feel abandoned “under the weight of the Cross” in our prayers in order that they might find hope in the resurrection.

     

    There was no public Mass or Vespers service held for Holy Saturday, for it is in the morning and afternoon that the Vatican Staff prepares the Basilica for the Easter Vigil, which started at
    8:30. Like all Easter Vigils, it began with a single lighted candle, the Paschal candle, whose flame is shared with all those gathered. It symbolizes the transition from the darkness of the Death
    of Christ to the light of His Resurrection. In his homily, he asked those present if they remembered their “Galilee”, the place where Christ touched their hearts and called them to be His
    disciples. He urged them to return to that “Galilee”, for there is where the Lord is waiting. It is not mere remembrance, or nostalgia, but “It is returning to our first love, in order to receive
    the fire which Jesus has kindled in the world and to bring that fire to all people, to the very ends of the earth.” After the homily, he baptized ten people from Vietnam, Belarus, Senegal,
    Lebanon, Italy, and France. He asked every single one of them if they wanted to be baptized, to which they all assented.

     

    A few hours later, 150,000 people were gathered in St. Peter’s Square for Easter Sunday Mass. The Square was decorated with an array of daffodils, hyacinths, and white roses. His Holiness noted
    that this year Easter coincides in both Western and Eastern Christianity. He called upon the faithful to pray for peace in the Ukraine, which is still struck with political turmoil, Syria and
    Nigeria, where the Christian population is persecuted, and Palestine, which His Holiness will be visiting next month. He also asked those present to take care of those at home, “sharing with the
    needy, standing at the side of the sick, elderly and the outcast.”

            Saint of the Issue: Pope John Paul II        

Topical · Rich · Apr2014

    by Katie Rich

     

    This past Divine Mercy Sunday, April 26, 2014, two 20th century popes were canonized: Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II. Though Pope John XXIII has been dead for 50 years, anyone over the age
    of 9 has lived during part, if not all ,of Pope John Paul II’s papacy. His was the second longest papacy in Church history and he was the first non-Italian successor of Peter since 1523. Even
    these facts aside, JPII was loved around the world by Catholics and non-Catholics alike, and his eventful life is certainly noteworthy.

    Karol Josef Wojtyla was born on May 18, 1920 in Wodowice, Poland, a town 35 miles from Krakow. He was named after his father, a Polish army lieutenant, and as a
    boy was nicknamed “Lolek.” His older sister died before his birth, his mother died when he was eight, and his older brother died when he was 12, so Karol grew up mostly living with only his
    father. As a boy, he frequently played soccer games at his school, where the teams were divided between Jews and Catholics. Karol would frequently volunteer to play for the Jewish team; this
    simple exposure to his Jewish neighbors and the childhood friends he made playing soccer in the streets would impact the rest of his life.

     

    Karol and his father moved to Krakow when he was 18, where he attended the Jagiellonian University. He studied a variety of subjects, including 12 different languages, nine of which he used
    frequently as pope. It was the theater, however, that really intrigued him and he studied playwriting and poetry with great interest.

     

    In 1939 the Nazi occupation began in Poland, effectively closing the university. Karol was forced to work a number of jobs, including as a miner in a limestone quarry, while caring for his ailing
    father in the little free-time he had. His father died of a heart-attack in 1941, leaving Karol l alone without any immediate family. This sparked a deeper interest in discerning the priesthood,
    which he actively began to pursue by knocking on the Bishop of Krakow’s door in October 1942. He began studying at the underground seminary run by the Bishop in the face of the Nazi occupation.
    On August 6, 1944, Karol hid in the basement of his uncle’s house while the Gestapo searched the rooms above. His hiding place saved him from being one of the eight thousand men and boys taken
    and sent to camps that day.

     

    The German occupation ended the night of January 17, 1945, and the seminarians were able to study openly again. Karol Wojtyla was ordained a priest on All Saints Day 1946. Shortly afterwards he
    was sent to Rome to study at the Pontifical International Athenaeum Angelicum, and he defended his doctoral thesis about St. John of the Cross on June 19, 1948. His first pastoral assignment was
    back in Poland, in a town only 15 miles from Krakow, called Niegowic. He later transferred to the parish of St. Florian in Krakow, and taught ethics at his alma mater, Jagiellonian University. He
    started a small prayer group called Rodzinka, “little family,” that grew from 20 members to over 200 members, known for their annual outdoor trips like kayaking and skiing. He earned his
    Doctorate in Sacred Theology, studying a combination of Thomism and phenomenology.

     

    On July 4, 1958 Karol was appointed auxiliary bishop of Krakow by Pope Pius XII, and appointed Archbishop of Krakow on January 13, 1964 by Pope Paul VI. On June 26, 1967 Paul VI promoted him to
    the College of Cardinals. After only a 33 day papacy of John Paul I, another conclave was held, and on October 22, 1978, at the age of only 58, Cardinal Wojtyla was inaugurated pope and he took
    the name John Paul II as a tribute to his predecessor.

     

    Pope Saint John Paul II is known for his love of both youth and women, and his vigorous travels. He visited 129 countries over the course of his papacy, founded World Youth Day, and was the first
    pope to visit the White House and meet the then president, Jimmy Carter, in 1979. He also famously returned to Poland and visited Auschwitz. He wrote 14 papal encyclicals and preached “The
    Theology of the Body.” He died on April 2, 2005, and was beatified on May 1, 2011, only six years later. He was canonized in a joint ceremony celebrated by Pope Francis and Pope Emeritus Benedict
    XVII, and along with Pope John XXIII, making last Sunday the day of four popes.

        Pro-Life: Incarnation - The Torch BC

            Pro-Life: Incarnation        

Topical · Conroy · Apr2014

    by Kate Conroy

     

    As far as unplanned pregnancies go, the Virgin Mary holds the trump card of surprise pregnancy stories. I’d like to hear one that could beat hers- she was a virgin, so it almost broke up her
    engagement and completely destroyed her reputation. And this is all during a time when women pregnant out of wedlock were stoned to death for adultery.

    We can’t say that this was completely without agreement of her part; let’s be honest, she did have a say in the matter, her Fiat: “Behold the handmaid of the Lord;
    let it be unto me according to thy word” (Luke 1:38). But still, an Angel coming to her and telling her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you”
    (Luke 1:35), explaining that she will be pregnant, without any action on her part, must have been rather shocking. Also she didn’t immediately believe it. She questioned the angel, saying, “How
    can this be, since I do not know a man?” (Luke 1:34). Despite this, she agrees and takes on faith of what has been told to her.

     

    Pro-life values are essential to our rich understanding of the Incarnation. This stuck me when I was browsing Facebook and saw this meme posted by Catholic Memes: “Pro-choice Christians: The Word
    became a blob of tissue and oppressed Mary.”

     

    This meme, probably offensive to many, made me think more deeply about the meaning of John 1:14: “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us.” At first glance it may not seem that these words
    hold any profound pro-life significance. After all, isn’t it the pro-choice way to argue that the unborn are just a bunch of cells? The word “flesh” implies something beyond “tissue”; there is a
    distinct humanness to flesh. Our flesh is what makes us weak, but also the manner in which we live. To become human the Word became flesh, not tissue. Becoming fully human, the Word became flesh.

     

    Yet this still leaves open the pro-choice argument that the unborn are human, yet do not merit personhood because they lack awareness. To address this debate, I suggest that we examine the
    Visitation. Mary, early in her pregnancy and still not showing, goes to visit her cousin Elisabeth, the same cousin that Mary was told during the Annunciation was pregnant in her old age. As soon
    as Elisabeth hears Mary’s greeting she know that Mary is pregnant, “For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy” (Luke 1:44). Elisabeth’s
    baby, John the Baptist, is very much aware of what is going on. Not only does he manage to communicate to Elisabeth that Mary is pregnant, but also the importance of the child that she is
    carrying. Elisabeth says “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! But why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?” (Luke 1:42-43). John
    the Baptist as an unborn child, a miracle baby himself, already is very much filled with the Spirit, so it is not surprising that he would be able to sense the presence of Christ.

     

    Perhaps you don’t buy into these Gospel stories as Gospel truth. However, if you do, there is no denying that without assigning humanity, dignity and personhood to the unborn, these events are
    stripped of their value. Without these attributes the moment of the Incarnation becomes murky and we risk falling into serious heresies regarding the Christ’s natures.

            Music: Want an Open Heart? Go to an Open Mic.        

Topical · Apr2014 · Vasile

    by Mary Vasile

     

    “Who hears music, feels his solitude peopled at once.” –Robert Browning

     

    I spent my semester abroad in Cork, Ireland. I lived about a three-minute walk from a church in which there was very little interaction between people. No Kiss of Peace, no uniform Mass responses
    (people mixed the old and new with regularity), and no universal cadence or rhythm to anything, not even the Our Father, which was taken at breakneck speed. Communion was a free-for-all, and just
    stepping into the aisle was a leap of faith. To be honest, the atmosphere was a little icy. I don’t think anyone ever really looked over and greeted his neighbor.

    I was also struck by the complete lack of music. Although, to be honest, at first I thought to myself, “Yes! Fastest Masses ever!” Eventually, though, I couldn’t
    stand the silence. I missed opening songs, sung psalms, and communion hymns. They really do warm up the Mass. I missed the music through which God gathers the congregation together. I missed the
    community that develops spontaneously when people sing along to something. I realized that music is not just an outlet for our creativity; by bringing us together, it reminds us of the ultimate
    creative Being, the master composer and conductor. Without music, I was keenly aware of being disconnected from the people around me, which was difficult for a foreigner.

     

    So I had to look elsewhere for that musical community. Luckily, I didn’t have to look too far. My roommate Aimee was a bluegrass fiddler, I had a guitar, and we both sang, so we decided pretty
    early on that we were going to be collaborators. We’d go through our repertoire, practice a set, and then, every week, haul ourselves over to the Brú Bar Open Mic Nights.

     

    They were usually quiet nights, as most open mic nights in Cork were Mondays, but there was always a small, faithful gathering of familiar faces. There was the guy that sang his own
    heart-breaking songs about war (cheery, I know). There was the guy who joined in with his friends on kazoo (you wouldn’t think it would work, but it did). And there was the band that always
    closed the evening, usually with “Hit the Road, Jack” (and with a chorus like that one, you got everyone singing). Aaron, the bartender, would tell you when you were up next, and offer you a pint
    when you were done.

     

    When you got up onstage, your voice flowed through a sound system that was slightly imbalanced until Aaron adjusted it, and then your song became part of the very air.

     

    Some people stopped and listened, some continued chatting, and some sang along, but it didn’t matter what they did. It mattered that they let that music seep into their talk and their drinks and
    their weary Mondays. It mattered that the line between performer and audience was constantly fluctuating, that borders between people were deteriorating. It mattered that those lyrics and notes
    were flitting through bits of conversation, slowly bringing people out of the cold, rainy night and gathering them together. And in those intertwining melodies, voices, and rhythms, I caught
    glimpses of the Conductor at work.

     

    I know this because good things started happening. Songs grew familiar and faces got names. For instance, one day as I was walking around Cork, I saw this guy singing and playing his guitar on
    the street. I recognized him from the open mic, so I just went up and introduced myself. His name was Darren, he had a great voice, and we had a lovely conversation that never would have happened
    without music.

     

    People sometimes didn’t even know the good that they did. One night, I was feeling pretty downcast, and then someone started playing Tom Petty. It was exactly what I needed. Another night, a guy
    came up to me to say he had heard Aimee and me on the night he arrived in Cork, four months before. He had been dreading living there, but when he heard us, he felt uplifted and found the courage
    to face his new life.

     

    Pretty soon, all this interweaving of sounds and people started soothing the homesickness and filling in the community I was missing. I still went to Mass every Sunday because it was still
    important. I always found healing there because I chose to look for God in His beauty, and of course, I found Him—in the homily, the readings, the Eucharist.

     

    Here’s the problem, though, and here’s what gives Christians a bad reputation. I tried to find fellowship with the congregation, but the people there would not meet me halfway. It wasn’t just
    about the lack of music. That was just a symptom of a certain hardness of heart. They would not open their eyes, their ears, their mouths. They were silent, and that is not what we as Christians
    are called to be. We’re called to be active, to engage people, to show them Christ and see Christ in them. In the end, it was the silence of that congregation I found most unbearable.

     

    So in those Monday open mics, I tried to break that silence, to reach out, to connect with my fellow man. I saw how music was just God’s tool for helping strangers shake up the monotonous drone
    of everyday life, see the good in others, and realize they are never alone. The people I saw every Monday may not all have been Catholic, they may not have cared about Mass, they may not have
    even believed in God, but they never turned down a little “Wagon Wheel.” So if “Wagon Wheel” is how God wants me to show people His love and gather them together, I feel pretty lucky, and I’ll
    just go grab my guitar.

            My Religious Pilgrimage: An Agnostic’s Reflection on Eight Years of Jesuit Catholic Education        

Topical · Cossette · DevilsAdvocate · Apr2014

    by Anthony Cossette

     

    A casual browse through the Wikipedia page for the “existence of God” shows a plethora of arguments both for and against what one may call “God,” mainly in the theistic conception of the term in
    addition to others like the deistic and pantheistic. These entail conclusions that are neatly fitted into positions such as theism, positive atheism, negative atheism, strong agnosticism, weak
    agnosticism, and a whole host of other specious and unnecessary “isms.” My conclusion is that it would be incredibly presumptuous of anyone to pigeonhole me into any of those categories. Here I
    will explain why.

    I’ve been educated at Catholic schools my whole life, from pre-school and kindergarten all the way to the present. As I am on the cusp now of graduating from a
    distinguished Jesuit Catholic institution at the collegiate level, I feel the pervasive need to reflect on my experiences and how I arrived here at this moment in time with no regrets about
    coming to Boston College, despite my current status as a non-Catholic and religious skeptic.

     

    To begin with, even though I grew up in a predominantly Catholic household, went to Mass on Sundays as a child with my family, and underwent the necessary sacraments, I always had this strange
    feeling that I was just simply “going through the motions,” so to speak, without asking the essential “Why?” question. As I grew older and more independent in mind and spirit, it dawned on me
    that my reasons at the time for believing in God and partaking in the Catholic rituals were wrong; to me, it just appeared to be customary and socially acceptable to do so in the surface-level
    thinking my adolescent teenage mind was engaged in. Thus, one could say that I actually never left the Catholic faith since I was not authentically “in it” in the first place. Once I realized all
    of this in conjunction with my in-depth readings into science and philosophy, I knew I had to take a step back and continue to explore and meet people of all faiths and lack thereof, becoming a
    kind of “religious pilgrim” in the process and trying to seek out what time-honored truths in different faiths are the most readily applicable in practice.

     

    In the meantime, I must admit that I was introduced to the more radical so-called “New Atheist” movement as I was led astray by the likes of Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and the
    late Christopher Hitchens, often semi-facetiously referred to as the “Four Horsemen of the Anti-Apocalypse.” Some of their arguments against religion and God seemed compelling to me, but I still
    had to account for why the Western tradition, steeped in Christianity over two thousand long years of history, still had to have at least some meaning and value to me, rather than the little to
    no value that the atheists suggest they possess. Religious education is not at all dogmatic in some ways, yet at the same time does not verge toward the abyss of skepticism that can pose some
    dangerous problems in our current civilization. The holistic education that I have received at Boston College has struck the right balance in educating not only our minds and bodies but also our
    “souls,” whatever that means to most people. As a psychology major and philosophy minor, I like to equate the word “soul” with the term “consciousness.” Thus one could say that throughout my high
    school and college careers, the Jesuits have impressed upon me the importance of cultivating the inner self, or consciousness, to the maximum. Indeed, I feel like my consciousness has widened
    over the course of my Catholic education to the point where I consider my religious teachers as indispensable in assisting me with the development of my innermost self, perhaps even in the
    spiritual sense.

     

    While some of the rituals of Catholicism may be necessary, according to the believer, I do not think they are sufficient for living the true values of the Catholic faith as I conceive them, which
    all culminate in the principle of “love in action.” Notwithstanding these differences, my religious and spiritual beliefs are provisional and are a continuous attempt to work out the multifarious
    complexities of the human experience. I must go out of my way to ensure I am not perceived as an enemy to religion and a one-sided thinker, which I manifestly am not. With that I would like to
    reaffirm the inestimable virtues and values of Catholic education in an increasingly secular and pluralistic society. I have cherished my Boston College education and I would not trade it for
    anything else in the world.

     

    So what is my current stance on the “God” question? The great theologian and Doctor of the Church Thomas Aquinas remarked that it is more important to love God than to know Him. If this is true,
    how does one come to love God? My answer: loving and being a steward of all of His Creation, especially human beings.

            Pro-Life: Human Beings and Human Persons        

Topical · Conroy · Feb2014

    by Kate Conroy

     

    I have often been asked if Peter Singer’s defense of infanticide is a joke. The response to his argument is usually, “Is he being serious?” or, “This is satire right?”

     

    Singer is a professor of bioethics at Princeton University, and he is very serious. Although many find his arguments for infanticide repulsive and dismiss him as crazy, they are wrong to do so.
    Singer’s argument is based in the scientific evidence that there is no significant difference between a fetus that cannot be aborted and a newborn child. He questions why we consider one precious
    and the other disposable. You might be thinking this sounds a great deal like the pro-life movement’s argument – it does, except for one big difference: Singer believes that “after-birth
    abortion” should be legal.

    Singer believes that the error the pro-life movement makes is that we equate a human being with a human person. He posits that a human being needs to be self-aware
    in order to be considered a human person with a right to life (or any other rights for that matter). However, he does not give any reason that makes this distinction more than an arbitrary line
    in the sand.

     

    Even if we were to imagine that it is okay to draw an objective line in the sands of human development to mark the change from human non-person to human person, we could not. The lines of human
    development are and always will be blurred. As with any sort of continuum of development, there is no identifiable moment when a baby or fetus ceases to be a non-person and becomes a person. The
    only moment when there is a definite change is the moment of conception. At this moment there is something new that was not before. The fertilized embryo is not simply a development of the sperm
    and egg, but the beginning of a human being. Thus the only clear line occurs at conception.

     

    Still, perhaps this young human being is not a human person and thus not deserving of any rights. Pretending that we could define a moment when a non-person changes into a person, what would that
    moment be? The question this raises is how we define human person if being a human being is not enough. If our definition of human person does not include all human beings then naturally it will
    exclude some.

     

    Historically, whenever we define the human person to exclude certain human beings from being considered full human persons we allow atrocities to occur. The most notable circumstances of this are
    slavery, women’s inequality, and the holocaust. Denying a state of personhood to a human being is nothing short of dehumanization and objectification. Is this a road we want to go down again?

     

    Singer’s argument – despite his intentions and conclusions – supports the pro-life argument more than the pro-choice. His reasoning is sound up until he claims that a human being is not
    necessarily a human person. In a just society, can we allow for the possibility of murdering humans simply because it is possible that they might not truly be persons? Excluding some human beings
    from the domain of human persons will always be an arbitrary definition. The only reason to do so is to take advantage of the ones who are being excluded.

            The Call to Joy        

SeniorStaff · Rich · Apr2014

    by Katie Rich

     

    They say that April showers bring May flowers. But when April blizzards bring an unending 40 degree drizzle, it’s hard to stay optimistic. The end of the school year should be a time teeming with
    joy and happiness, no? By this time, Boston has usually shed its snaky winter skin and slithered into a beautiful spring. Salmon shorts and sundress-clad students should be gracing the lawns
    around campus, making everything feel lighter and that much more collegiate. Finals seem less daunting, graduation more bitter-sweet than just plain bitter, and that mountainous accumulation of
    reading you’ve been stock-piling since January doesn’t seem as formidable when you can tackle it while drinking iced coffee and soaking up some Vitamin D.

    When the sun sinks behind the giant gray clouds, however, so do our good spirits. Our thoughts are consumed with the amount of work we have, and the dismally
    miniscule amount of time we have to complete it in. Do I really still have over 200 pages to read for that class? If I add up all the pages of papers I have to write, is it really that many? And
    wait, that final is cumulative?! Once we start, it’s easy to spiral. Saying goodbye to friends will be unavoidable with
    graduation looming all-too-closely on the horizon, no matter what year you are. Plus, there’s the laundry you haven’t done, the friend you’ve been meaning to have coffee with before you never see
    them again, the broken pipe under your kitchen sink, you’ve been sniffling for weeks, and you can’t remember the last time you woke up feeling rested.

     

    Take a deep breath and imagine, for a minute, that it’s 2000 years ago. It’s a hot and dusty Sunday morning, and you and your buddy Cleopas have started walking to the next town over, roughly
    seven miles away. Don’t think you’ve escaped your stress, though. You have rocks in your sandals, and your feet are already filthy even though you have a lot of walking ahead of you. You’re
    pretty tired, haven’t had your coffee (poor first-century Palestine), but these things seem more than trivial when you think of what’s taken place the last few days. The carpenter from Nazareth
    had convinced you that he really might be the One you’d been waiting for all these years. You thought that he might deliver your people from the hands of the Romans, and Israel would be lifted up
    to glory again like it had been under David. Everything had been looking up. But on Friday, he’d been killed, suffering a grueling death that no true king would ever have endured. As one of his
    followers, even though you weren’t really close to him, you’re afraid for your life, so you and Cleopas decided to leave Jerusalem for a while. On top of all this, some nitwit decided that he’s
    going to tag along with you. The guy’s a joke, too – he has no clue about what’s been happening the past few days. And then, once you’ve explained everything to him, he decides he does know
    something, and proceeds to lecture you about the scriptures that you understand very well yourself, thank you very much. And he called you foolish? Who does this guy think he his?
    Doesn’t he know you have enough to deal with without his pestering?

     

    The disciples on the road to Emmaus were quite literally walking with Christ, and they nearly missed him. They were too caught up dwelling in their own misery to witness something exquisitely
    beautiful that was beside them all along.

     

    Easter isn’t just a day, but a season. Christians are called to celebrate the living God for 50 days after Easter Sunday. For some perspective, that’s 10 days longer than Lent. With the advent of
    Ash Wednesday, we jump willingly into those 40 days of fasting and prayer. We don’t seem to have a big problem reminding ourselves to be repentant. But when we are told that we should be joyful
    for the entire 50 days of Easter, keeping the Resurrection close to our hearts, we shrink away from the seemingly insurmountable task. As Christians, we are called to be joyful. This doesn’t mean
    happy-go-lucky, or blissfully unaware of the problems of the world around us. But it is important, especially in this Easter season, to keep the joy of Christ alive in our hearts, no matter how
    dismal our day-to-day dealings may seem.

            Protestant Perspective: Ecclesia Semper Reformanda Est        

Hertenstein · SeniorStaff · Apr2014

    by Mark Hertenstein

     

    It was difficult deciding on what topic to write for this final Protestant Perspective. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther, ecumenism, social issues I have thus far ignored, a planned (and
    unwritten) article on the culture of estrangement in our society. But ultimately it made the most sense to return to what precisely Protestantism means and what the place of Protestantism is in
    the scope of Christianity. This is the overall project that guided the column for these recent years.

     

    When we say “Protestant,” what do we mean? What is the guiding principle of the Reformation? Do we mean a set of fundamentalists, schismatics, anti-institutionalists, or something along those
    lines?

    First, I have argued that those definitions are horribly wrong. When we say “Protestant,” we should mean that we are guided by the principles that informed the
    Reformers, the first “Protestants.” The aim of the Reformation was never schism or anti-this-or-that. The aim was to refine and reform the practice and doctrine of the Catholic Church.

     

    We can judge that the Reformation, in the sense of its aims, has had a track-record of failure. There are literally thousands of denominations (or independent churches) today. Its historical
    result has been schism. But we should not let historical development become the norm, and we Protestants should not let misunderstandings or our principle of reformation and aim of purity become
    an excuse for false notions of perfection and schism. That would go against the very guiding principle of Reformation, and therefore Protestantism.

     

    The Protestant Principle, especially as defined by Paul Tillich, is the principle that because revelation and development of belief occurs in a temporal and finite world, and the revelation is of
    a transcendent and infinite God, those temporal expressions of Christian faith must ever anew be questioned and refined by doubt that leads to further insight. The Protestant Principle is not
    that we should dismiss traditions because they are old, but refine them and observe how they may be renewed and reformed to further the truth that is continually fresh and being revealed. The
    Protestant Principle is simply that the transcendent truth of Christianity is not reducible to the historical forms in which it can be found. On this, Bonhoeffer concurred by saying that purity
    of doctrine is a goal, not an actual accomplishment at the present, for the Church.

     

    Even the Roman Catholic Church has expressed this idea in the last 50 years. When Pope St. John XXIII called for the Second Vatican Council, he spoke of a need for aggiornamento, the idea that
    the windows needed to be opened to let in fresh air. The underlying idea that the Church was always in need of renewal, always in need of a new moment of Pentecost, drove the Council. The
    Protestant Principle is not a dividing principle, but a principle that can drive ecumenical dialogue, and ultimately further understanding and ultimate reunion.

     

    On this basis, the Protestant Principle is that the Christian Church, doctrine, and practice must continually be renewed and reformed. The Reformation is a principle, not just a historical event
    that resulted in schism. On this basis, we can renew the spirit of the Reformation such that it will result in a fuller understanding among churches, and within the universal Church.

     

    Ultimately, the test of the Reformation will be its ability to finish its task- reform, not schism. That means that the Protestant Principle must bring about a fullness of unity and charity among
    the local churches, and a unity of the Catholic Church. It will do that, but we must be open to God’s revelation of the truth of Christianity as it is encountered anew every day. We must be open
    to the application of the Protestant Principle to our own Protestant Reformation.

     

    The goal of the Reformation of Luther’s time was to correct bad practice and doctrine. The goal of the Reformation in our day is the reunion of churches to realize again and concretely the One,
    Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.

            Chosen for Each Other        

Canniff · SeniorStaff · Apr2014

    by Chris Canniff

     

    I will be graduating in a few weeks, but I am not quite feeling the same anxiety that my classmates are experiencing because I will be back at BC next year for graduate school. While the majority
    of the Class of 2014 will be heading off to different parts of the country and other parts of the world for new schools or new jobs, I will be here living in the same dorms, eating in the same
    dining halls, studying in the same libraries, learning in the same classrooms, and working with the same professors. Whereas my classmates will be experiencing so many new things, so much will be
    the same for me. What will be strikingly different, however, is precisely the fact that my classmates will not be here with me.

    Over four years at BC, you accrue many friends and many more acquaintances. It is these people whom I will miss very much next year. Inviting a friend to come hang
    out at a moment’s notice, the chance of running into a friend during the day and stopping for a quick chat, or the occurrence of a simple smile and wave when you spot a friend walking on the
    other side of the quad—this is what I will miss. Certainly, I have friends who are underclassmen, so it is not like I will be alone. It is just that far fewer of the people whom I know best will
    be here with me; these people with whom I have most closely shared my BC experience will not be a part of this next chapter of my time here.

     

    C.S. Lewis once said, “In friendship...we think we have chosen our peers. In reality, a few years’ difference in the dates of our births, a few more miles between certain houses, the choice of
    one university instead of another, posting to different regiments, the accident of a topic being raised or not raised at a first meeting—any of these chances might have kept us apart. But, for a
    Christian, there are, strictly speaking, no chances. A secret Master of Ceremonies has been at work. Christ, who said to the disciples, ‘You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,’ can truly
    say to every group of Christian friends ‘You have not chosen one another, but I have chosen you for one another.’ The friendship is not a reward for our discrimination and good taste in finding
    one another out. It is the instrument by which God reveals to each the beauties of all the others.”

     

    Now, these circumstances drawn up by the “secret Master of Ceremonies” to bring us together will yield unto other circumstances which, on the contrary, may lead us apart. It is a bit sad and
    scary to think about this. These new circumstances will surely bring us to meet new people in life and make new friends, but what about these ones whom we have made here? I suppose that I do not
    really have an answer for this.

     

    It will be hard to say goodbye to friends whom I have known since freshman year. It will also be hard to say goodbye to friends whom I have met only this year and whom I wish I had more time to
    get to know. The best I can think to say is that we should simply be grateful that the Master of Ceremonies ever chose these friends for us in the first place. The beauty that we have come to see
    in them and to know through them is all thanks to Him. To have even known that beauty is more than we deserve, and yet He has given it to us abundantly in our friends. How truly beautiful it has
    been to be here with them!

            Guidepost: ‘14 Forever        

SeniorStaff · Elliott · Apr2014

    by Nikki Elliott

     

    “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.”

    − Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)

     

    I’ve never been good with change. I love routines, and I love consistency. So you can imagine my anxiety when I came to BC freshmen year, overwhelmed by the unfamiliarity of college life and the
    culture shock of living on the East Coast. The excitement and sense of possibility I had all summer in anticipation of freshman year quickly evolved into fear when I realized the naivety of my
    expectations. Fortunately, I quickly learned that I was not alone, and that all of us were in some way or another

    trying to figure the new adjustment out, trying to figure ourselves out. I think it is safe to say that we all eventually formed our circles here at BC—friends,
    teams, clubs, classmates, roommates, performance groups—some of us sooner than others, all of us in our own unique ways. I personally had trouble settling into BC and into college life in
    general, but I remember finding comfort in a deepening relationship with God. My faith became central and pervasive—to say I bought into the Jesuit “find God in all things” business is an
    understatement. I wholly embraced it. BC made this so easy; I felt a nearness to God that I had never experienced before, and I felt His presence in the places and faces of a mere ordinary day.
    For the first time, my faith became my own, not that of my parents or a product of my twelve years of catholic education, but mine.

     

    In my very first Guidepost article for The Torch back in September, I spoke on the mysterious ways BC inspires a certain spiritual vigor and intellectual curiosity and encourages an engagement
    with life that is full of passion and purpose. Now, eight months later and on the cusp of graduation, I can’t help but fear that what I am most grateful and thankful to have found at BC will fade
    when they hand me my diploma at Commencement. That leaving this place means losing sight of God in the small details of life and everyday experiences, losing the sense of safety and belonging
    that I have found on campus, and losing the faith that has been all my own the past four years. With these thoughts surface the same fear and anxiety that I experienced during my transition to
    BC, and, as much as it hurts to admit, I am scared. Scared of failing, scared of feeling alone, scared of falling into the unconscious day-in-day-out default.

     

    Remember, though, that scary isn’t the same as impossible, and even in the midst of tumultuous change, God is constant and ever faithful. As we come to the last few weeks together as a senior
    class, agonizing over the end belittles the whole future of possibility ahead. The transition might not be easy; there will be challenges, disappointments, and tests of faith, but BC did not
    prepare us to take the next step with worry and fear. Go forward with confidence and tenacity, with the sure knowledge that God will be with you wherever you go, guiding us in His “plan to
    prosper...and give us a hope and a future,” in much the same way that He guided us here to BC.

     

     

    Dear Lord, be with me and guide me through these times of change, uncertain directions, and new beginnings. Turn my attention away from fear and toward a future full of possibility.

    Amen

            Let It Go and Let God        

SeniorStaff · Yuhas · Apr2014

    by Natalie Yuhas

     

    I’ve always hated change for as long as I can remember. I like to watch movies I have seen before and already know that I enjoy, read books that I’ve read before, and I hate when I come home from
    college and find that my parents have changed something about our house. I’m still recovering from the fact that my family moved to a new house in a different town when I was in the first grade.
    So, it’s safe to say that I was furious when Disney released the movie Frozen earlier this year. Disney princesses were a huge part of my childhood. How dare they make two new
    Disney princesses and mess with the classics. I told myself that I would not go see it under any circumstances and that I would only stick to watching the classics, but then so many people kept
    telling me how amazing it is and how much I would love it. After a few weeks, I finally cracked and decided that I wanted to go see Frozen during Christmas break.

    It should have been my worst nightmare. Frozen was completely different than any Disney princess movie before it. The animation was different, the characters’ personalities were
    different, and most importantly, the message was completely different. Instead of focusing on true love between the prince and the princess, the movie focused on the true love between sisters.
    With Frozen, Disney shattered the fairy tale idea of “true love’s kiss” and replaced it instead with the fresh idea that love is a sacrifice. As much as I wanted to hate Frozen,
    I just couldn’t. In fact, I loved Frozen. It’s now one of my favorite movies and I am currently watching it, and of course singing along, while I write this article.

     

    This happens to me all the time. I like to hold onto places, friends, traditions, etc. that have been reliable and have good memories attached to them. When things do change, I get so hung up on
    the past and resenting anything that is new or different, that I miss out on the opportunities that change can bring. I think that I have such a problem with change because it means that so much
    is out of my control. What if the future only holds sadness and hurt? Since I’ve come to college, I’ve had to deal with some of the biggest changes of my life so far, including moving far away
    from home, changing majors, and joining new clubs and making new friends. Although Boston College has been nothing like my high school or my hometown, every change and opportunity has been so
    rewarding and I am slowly learning that change is a good thing. Even though the future may be scary and unpredictable, we have to trust that God has a beautiful plan for each of us, and the
    changes we meet along the way will help us grow. As Queen Elsa from Frozen would say, “Let It Go” and let God.

            He Was The One        

Faculty · Apr2014

    by Fr. William C. Russell, SJ

     

    Fr. William C. Russell, SJ, a native of Winthrop, MA, entered the Society of Jesus in 1952 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1965. After completing his studies at Boston College and
    Harvard University, Fr. Russell studied philosophy and theology in France. When he returned to the United States he served as rector of the Jesuit Community at the Jesuit School of Theology at
    Berkeley in California, president of Cheverus High School, director of admissions at Boston College High School, province assistant for development, province vocation director, and superior of
    the Patrick House Jesuit Community in Kingston, Jamaica. He is now retired and is a member of the Boston College Jesuit Community.

    In one of her many who-done-its, Agatha Christie wrote:

     

    “Much of life is recalling past memories. Real happiness is when we find someone to remember them with. But when we grow old that’s not always easy to do, because we’ve outlived our
    contemporaries. But just to sit there and remember somehow—in a strange way—makes us come alive again.”

     

    Thank you for inviting me to share one of my memories with you…

     

    ______________

     

     

    He was the one who taught me how to swim when I was barely taller than a tennis racket, holding me in the shallow of the lake, close to the shore. I was frightened by the cold of the water on my
    skin, frightened that I might sink to the bottom, frightened that I might cry, but he held me in his arms, telling me over and over again that he would never let me go.

     

    He was the one who taught me my prayers, reading them from a book, because he couldn’t remember them, understanding little of what he asked or heard because he wasn’t even Catholic.

     

    He was the one who asked God’s blessing on the food my mother set before us at table.

     

    He was the one who blessed us each night before we went up to bed.

     

    He was the one who let me drive the car, turning the steering wheel and honking the horn, as he held me on his lap.

     

    He was the one who drove me to my first summer job and picked me up at the end of the workday, explaining to me that now that I was a man—what was I? 14?—and earning a salary I would have to pay
    $25 of the $27 I earned each week for board and room…even though I was living in my own house.

     

    He was the one who, years later, gave it all back to me with interest, telling me that it was mine to spend any way I wished.

     

    He was the one who helped me carry my footlocker up four flights of stairs, and who sat on the edge of my bed and told me how proud he was to have his son in college and how he knew that I would
    work hard at my studies because he would be spending 1/5 of his income on 1/8 of his family, but that I was worth every penny.

     

    He was the one who, 62 years ago, drove me to the Berkshires and hugged me one last time as I began my life as a Jesuit and watched as he wiped tears from his eyes…the one and only time I saw him
    cry.

     

    He was the one who, when my mother died, told me that there would be no marker on her grave, that she had always been too frail to support a stone, and that she wouldn’t be there anyway, that she
    would go straight to God.

     

    He was the one who, at the end of his life, told us what we already knew: that there would be no inheritance, that whatever he had had long since been spent, and we knew that it had been spent on
    us.

     

    He was the one who loved our mother with a passion, and whose love was returned in kind.

     

    He was my father, and I cannot begin to tell you how proud I am to be his son.

        Nunz ‘n the Hood - The Torch BC

            Nunz ‘n the Hood        

Faculty · Apr2014

    by Mary Ann Hinsdale, IHM

     

    Sr. Mary Ann Hinsdale is a member of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Before coming to Boston College in 2000, she was at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA
    where she taught theology, was the Chair of the Religious Studies department, and served as a Director of Women’s Studies. Hinsdale specializes in ecclesiology, Christology, theological anthropology, and feminist theologies.

     

    One of BC’s best kept secrets might be the “Nunz ‘n the Hood”! Lest you think this is some new acapella group, riffing on the 1991 movie “Boyz ‘n the Hood,” I want to assure you that the members
    of this group comprise the real life “nuns” (more accurately, “Sisters”) who minister here at Boston College as professors, administrators, and staff members.

    The “Nunz” began gathering together in each other’s homes back in 2002 to share prayer and a meal and to reflect together on their ministry at Boston College. The
    moniker “Nunz ‘n the Hood” began as sort of a joke, but somehow it stuck. Some of us belong to congregations that have roots in the Boston area, or are linked to BC because of membership in the
    Society of the Sacred Heart, the sponsoring order of the former Newton College of the Sacred Heart (NCSH) which merged with BC in 1974. Others of us are missioned here by our communities because
    BC had an opening in an area of our professional expertise which our own orders did not have.

     

    The members of the “Nunz” has fluctuated over the years, but today there are eleven Sisters who come together, usually once a semester, for an evening of “sharing, snacks and sisterhood.” Four of
    us are members of the Society of the Sacred Heart (RSCJ): Jean Bartunek, RSCJ, who holds the Robert A. and Evelyn J. Ferris Chair of Organization Studies in CSOM, has taught at BC since 1977;
    Hilda Carey, RSCJ, graduated from Newton College and has been teaching in the English Department since 1986; Gail O’Donnell, RSCJ also a graduate of Newton College, directed the sabbatical
    program at the former Weston Jesuit School of Theology, and now teaches part time as well as ministers as a spiritual director at the STM; and Barbara Quinn, RSCJ, who came to the School of
    Theology and Ministry in 2011 as Associate Director of Spiritual Formation. The RSCJs are an international order whose North American provincial house is located in St. Louis. They have had a
    close relationship with the Jesuits since the beginning of their founding by St. Madeleine Sophie Barat. “In fact, the RSCJs have had such a close relationship with Jesuits from the beginning
    that working at BC feels like being part of a family enterprise,” commented Sr. Barbara.

     

    Sr. Diane Dube, RJM, is a Religious of Jesus and Mary, an international order based in Rome. Their US headquarters are located in Washington, DC. Diane works as Service Center Representative at
    the STM and is in her tenth year working with the Jesuits. She notes, “It is a joy to be here at BC among the young who love God and who plan to continue the good work God has begun.” Another
    RJM, Janice Farnham, was also part of the “Nunz” for the years during which she taught church history first at Weston and then at the STM.

     

    Sr. Callista Roy, CSJ, -- no stranger to nursing students—is a Sister of St. Joseph of Carondelet from Orange, CA. Sr. Callista came to BC in 1987 as a Professor and Nurse Theorist, specifically
    to implement the Ph.D. in Nursing. Another Sister of St. Joseph “in the ‘hood” is Sr. Annette McDermott, SSJ (Springfield, MA). Sr. Annette is getting her doctorate in political science at BC and
    also ministers as a Catholic chaplain at Mt. Holyoke College.

     

    The remaining “Nunz ‘n the hood” are the only representatives of their orders at BC: Sr. Meg Guider, OSF, worked for some years as a lay missionary in Brazil before joining the Franciscans of
    Joliet, IL. She received her doctorate from Harvard in missiology, began teaching at Weston Jesuit in 1991, and when Weston re-affiliated with BC Sr. Meg continued to teach in the Ecclesiastical
    Faculty at the STM. Sr. Mary Sweeney, SC, is a Sister of Charity of Halifax. As a BC Campus Minister, Sr. Mary directs the RCIA program and does outreach to graduate students. She’s been at BC
    for the past eleven years, nine of them as a Resident Minister in Duchesne Hall on the Newton Campus.

     

    I, too, am the sole member of my religious congregation at BC. The IHM Sisters (Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Monroe, MI) have more theologians than we have institutions in
    which they can serve. So, since 1987 I, too, have been collaborating with the Jesuits, first at the College of the Holy Cross and since 2000, at BC. Like most of the “Nunz ‘n the hood” I always
    introduce myself as a sister to my classes and use my order’s initials after my name. But I am also comfortable with students calling me “Professor” or “Doctor”—which sometimes surprises them. I
    started doing that ever since I met an undergrad at Holy Cross who told me he didn’t think that Sisters could actually teach at the college level. “Not only that,” I told him, “but Sisters have
    founded colleges and universities and have served as their Presidents and Deans!

     

    As Sr. Callista put it, although “Nunz ‘n the Hood” are a loose-knit group, with intermittent get-togethers, we share a special bond together.” Perhaps one of these days we will indeed become a
    BC acapella group—who knows?

            The Three Books        

Faculty · Mar2014

    by Kenneth J. Hughes, S.J.

     

    Kenneth J. Hughes, S.J. is a visiting spiritual director at Boston College.

    He is a member of the New England Province and resides in the St. Peter Faber Jesuit Community, Brighton.

     

    St. Bernard of Clairvaux, back in the 12th century, spoke of three books which God has given us to read: The Book of Nature, The Book of Scripture, and The Book of Personal Experience. For each
    person these three books are always available and wonderfully timeless. How enriched we would be if we read from each book daily -- now reading from Nature, now reading from Scripture, now
    reflecting on our Experience! Here are a few comments on each book.

    The Book of Nature

     

    Jesuit poet, Gerard Manley Hopkins, in “God’s Grandeur,” notes that “the world is charged with the grandeur of God,” but complains that we have distanced ourselves from experiencing this
    grandeur: “nor can foot feel, being shod.” At this present time, with the advent of spring we can let our eyes casually spot the first snowdrops and daffodils, the first violets and tulip
    blossoms, smile for a brief moment, and move on, or, we can stop and linger a bit longer, really look at each flower’s beauty, glimpse the beauty of the One who created it, and so move to deeper
    joy and gratitude.

    The mother of Spanish poet Antonio Machado said to him when he was a boy, “Antonio, what have you done with your eyes?” She was chiding him for not taking time to look lovingly at the world
    around him. She speaks to us too. Are we truly seeing? “Seeing,” of course, means using all our senses: listening, tasting, touching, smelling. For example, Norwegian poet Hans Boerli, in his
    poem, “Sunrain,” observes that,

    “If you turn your ear to the wind

    and listen with all your heart,

    then you will hear distinctly

    God breathing.”

    Am I seeing, listening …?

     

     

    The Book of Scripture

     

    How often do we read the word of God? Do we call ourselves Christian and not ponder God’s word, Christ’s word? Do we say that Jesus is our friend and not contemplate his personality and actions?
    How well do we know our way around in this most precious book? Do we know where to turn to celebrate joy, be consoled in sorrow, find strength in difficulties? What Scripture passage is your
    favorite? Mine is Jesus saying, “I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.” (Jn.14.6). I keep going back to that saying so as to be rooted in Jesus. I also underline with a thin red pen the passages
    which touch my spirit the most so that I can find them more easily when I need them for myself or for others. Would reading a prophet or a gospel or a few letters of St. Paul be a good Advent or
    Lenten project? In surprising ways, through Scripture, the Holy Spirit keeps meeting and stirring our spirit.

    Do I have my Bible near me always?

     

     

    The Book of Personal Experience

     

    With every year of our life, this book of personal experience becomes thicker as we add pages and chapters of our encounters with God – if we pay attention! Are we noticing those moments when God
    is revealing something of Himself, his care and love for us? For example, coincidences and surprises which elicit wonder are sure signs of God’s presence. Are we noticing? There may be moments of
    great joy -- “transfiguration” moments -- and moments of great insight into mystery -- “epiphany” moments -- but, more often, we only catch glimpses of God out of the corner of our eye. Rainer
    Maria Rilke speaks for all of us, I think, when he wrote to God:

     

    “We become so accustomed to you,

    we no longer look up

    when your shadow falls over the book we are reading

    and makes it glow. For all things

    sing you: at times

    we just hear them more clearly.”

    Am I alert and paying attention to the signs of God’s presence?

     

     

    I suggest that reading these three books will make all the difference between living a vibrant, meaningful, peace-filled life and living a superficially successful but rather vapid life. The road
    less travelled still makes “all the difference!”

            The Privileged Poor        

Faculty · Mar2014

    by Roberto Goizueta

     

    Roberto S. Goizueta is the Margaret O’Brien Flatley Professor of Catholic Theology at Boston College, where he has taught since
    1999.  Dr. Goizueta has served as President of the Catholic Theological Society of America and the
    Academy of Catholic Hispanic Theologians of the United States.  He has published and lectured extensively in the areas of U.S. Latino/a theology,
    liberation theology, and theological aesthetics.

     

    Shortly after becoming pope, Francis invited a Peruvian Dominican priest named Gustavo Gutiérrez to the Vatican. The two men concelebrated Mass together, shared meals, and had conversations.
    Since then, Gutiérrez has returned to visit with the Pope again, most recently several weeks ago. Fr. Gustavo Gutiérrez is known as the founder of Latin American liberation theology. At the heart
    of liberation theology are two principles that, contends Gutiérrez, are the two main, overarching themes in the Scriptures. These themes are: (1) the universality and gratuity of God’s love, and
    (2) God’s preferential love for the poor. Yet, how can it be that God loves everyone equally and also loves the poor preferentially?

     

    What initially seems like a contradiction is resolved, however, when we view God’s love through the eyes of the poor. The outcasts of our world know that,
    tragically, our world is divided between the powerful and the powerless, for the latter experience daily the painful consequences of that division. The persons in the best position to acknowledge
    the reality of division or conflict are those who suffer its consequences. In the words of Pope Francis, “we understand reality better not from the center but from the outskirts.” Conversely,
    those of us who benefit—whether explicitly or implicitly—from social and economic disparities are likely to either ignore these or deemphasize their significance. It is the hungry person, after
    all, who is in the best position to determine whether hunger exists in our society. In her Lectures on Philosophy, the French mystic Simone Weil observed: “Human beings are so made that
    the ones who do the crushing feel nothing; it is the person crushed who feels what is happening. Unless one has placed oneself on the side of the oppressed, to feel with them, one cannot
    understand.” In other words, the poor or powerless have a privileged perspective from which to evaluate “reality”, though such privilege in no way assumes infallibility or inevitability—only a
    greater likelihood of accuracy.

     

    Now, if our world is so divided between the powerful and the powerless, what can it mean to say that God enters into a world beset by such divisions? In such a divided world, what would it mean
    to say that God loves all people equally and gratuitously?

     

    For two thousand years the Christian tradition has proposed an answer that, for many, has seemed inconceivable, if not scandalous: Christians claim that, in such a world, the perfect expression
    of God’s love is found in the utter powerlessness of an unjustly condemned criminal who, having experienced abandonment by his closest friends and even God, hangs helplessly from a cross. God’s
    love enters history in the person of an outcast brutally tortured and unceremoniously executed for befriending other outcasts, for “hanging out with” lepers, prostitutes, and sinners. God’s love
    enters a divided society on the side of those who suffer the consequences of the division—not because God loves the outcast more, but because in the midst of division and conflict God’s love for
    the powerful and God’s love for the powerless must take different forms.

     

    By way of illustration, if a mother finds that a fight has broken out between her strapping teenage son and his much smaller sister, the mother will not hesitate to try to “liberate” the smaller
    girl from the brother’s clutches—precisely because the mother loves her two children equally. In that context, the mother’s love for her son will take the form of a call to “conversion”,
    though he will not likely see it that way. Were the mother to take a neutral stance and not get involved because she “loves her children equally,” the young daughter would not experience the
    neutrality as love. In a situation of division, a neutral stance is implicit support for the divided status quo and, therefore, implicit support for the person(s) benefiting from the division,
    i.e., the most powerful. Neutrality, like silence, is consent. To say that God’s love is universal, then, is not to say that it is neutral. In fact, it is to say the very opposite:
    precisely because God’s love is universal, it cannot be neutral.

     

    If God is truly transcendent, that is, if God is truly a Mystery beyond our capacity to understand fully, then God will be revealed in those places and among those people most incomprehensible to
    our society, among those people whose lives themselves simply “don’t make sense” to us. The God who does not belong will be found among those persons who themselves do not belong. God will be
    revealed most fully among the hungry in a gluttonous world, among the powerless in a power-mad world, among the vulnerable in a world obsessed with security, among the physically disabled in a
    world obsessed with physical appearance, among the immigrants in a world obsessed with building ever higher fences, among the poor in a world that idolizes wealth. The poor are privileged, not
    because they are necessarily good, but because God is good. They’re privileged because they are the witnesses to a God whose unconditional, universal love knows no borders, no
    boundaries, and no barriers. Whenever we are tempted—as we always are—to identify God with power and wealth, with security and social acceptance, the powerless, poor, and forgotten people of our
    world are there to remind us of our idolatry, to remind us that we can never predict or circumscribe God’s love. They remind us of the scandalous message of the Gospel, namely, that a crucified
    convict is the perfect embodiment of God’s love. “‘Lord when did we see you hungry and give you food? When did we see you thirsty and give you a drink? When did we see you a stranger and take you
    in? When did we see you needing clothes and give you clothes? When did we see you sick or in prison and come to visit you?’” (Mt 25:37-39).

        Blessed John XXIII National Seminary and Boston College Connections - The Torch BC

            Blessed John XXIII National Seminary and Boston College Connections        

Faculty · Feb2014 · Healey

    by Charles J. Healey, S.J.

     

    Fr. Charles J. Healey, S.J. is a member of the Jesuit Community at Boston College and has been a member of the University Chorale for roughly 40 years. He is currently professor of systematic
    and spiritual theology at Blessed John XXIII Seminary and is presently writing a history of the Seminary as part of the observance of its 50th anniversary.

     

     

    Boston College has recently completed a successful celebration of the sesquicentennial anniversary of its founding. It is well to note that there is another nearby institution celebrating its
    50th anniversary this year that has a number of connections with Boston College. The institution is Blessed John XXIII National Seminary in Weston, MA, founded in 1964.

     

    Richard Cardinal Cushing, the Archbishop of Boston from 1944 to 1970, announced in 1963: “I have decided with God’s help, with the approval of the Holy See and
    with the aid of generous benefactors to build that seminary in the Archdiocese of Boston as a National Seminary for older men, endowed with the necessary educational and spiritual qualities who
    have been called by God to His Holy Priesthood. Construction will begin before the end of this year.”

     

    This new seminary in Weston would have a unique and novel mission. It was to be established for the training of older vocations, men called to the priesthood at an older age and thus coming to
    their seminary studies with much life experience. At that time there was no other seminary for this purpose in the United States, and in the world for that matter, with the exception of the
    Pontifical Beda Seminary in Rome, established by the bishops of England in 1898.

     

    Archbishop (later Cardinal) Dino Staffa, Secretary of the Congregation of Seminaries, was present as the personal representative of Pope Paul VI for the formal dedication of the Seminary in
    Weston on September 5, 1964. In the presence of the rector/president, faculty, and many invited guests, Cardinal Cushing consecrated the chapel, dedicated the building, and formally opened the
    doors of the new building. One of the founding faculty members at this time was Fr. James W. DeAdder, a priest of the Archdiocese of Boston and a graduate of Boston College.

     

    On September 7, 1964, forty-five men, between the ages of 28 and 58 and coming from all walks of life, reported to the Seminary to begin their priestly formation. Two came from as far away as
    Australia, and altogether 28 different dioceses were represented. Four years later, 23 of them were ordained to the priesthood. Cardinal Cushing ordained seventeen from this number in June1968 at
    St. Ignatius Church on the Boston College Campus. Since that historic beginning, over 600 priests have been ordained from the Seminary, representing some 150 dioceses and religious communities.
    Cardinal Cushing’s vision and dream have indeed become a reality.

     

    A number of Jesuits from the BC Jesuit Community and others from Boston College have been affiliated with Blessed John XXIII Seminary over the course of its 50 years. I have been a professor of
    systematic and spiritual theology for close to 30 years, serving also as academic dean for fifteen of those years. Members of the BC theology department who later became full-time members of the
    seminary faculty include Frs. T. Frank Devine, S.J., William Leonard, S.J. and Paul Gilmartin, S.J., as well as former administrator, Fr. George Drury, S.J. Other full-time members of the
    seminary faculty with Boston College connections were Fr. Leo Manglaviti, S.J. and Fr. John Moriarty, S.J. Fr. Ronald Tacelli, S.J. of the philosophy department at BC is currently an adjunct
    professor in the Seminary’s pre-theology program, and Professor Peter Kreeft also taught for a period in that program. Two long time professors who taught as adjunct professors after their
    retirement from BC were Frs. Frederick Moriarty, S.J. and John Willis, S.J.

     

    Boston College faculty members who served as members of the Seminary’s Board of Trustees include Dr. Mary Griffin, former dean of the School of Education, and Fr. Matthew Lamb and Fr. Robert
    Imbelli, former members of the theology department. Among the number of BC graduates who studied for the priesthood at the Seminary is Fr. Nicholas Sannella, a priest of the Archdiocese of Boston
    and a longtime member of the Board of Trustees of Boston College.

     

    As Blessed John XXIII National Seminary currently observes the 50th anniversary of its founding in 1964, it is fitting to note its many connections with Boston College. It is also fitting that
    during this anniversary year, the Seminary’s patron, Pope John XXIII, will be canonized in Rome during Easter Week of this year.

    On Wednesday, December 11, two of The Torch’s senior staff columnists who have been studying abroad in Rome this semester had an amazing encounter with Pope Francis.

     

    Each Wednesday, the Holy Father holds a general audience in St. Peter’s Square. The night before, Ethan Mack and Katie Rich, both A&S ’15, went to a clerical clothing store and purchased a
    white zucchetto in Francis’ size to give to him. On Wednesday morning, they arrived in St. Peter’s Square early so that they could position themselves right up along the barricades, near where
    the popemobile would drive by. Inside the zucchetto, they had placed a note which read, “Boston College loves our Jesuit pope!”

    When Pope Francis drove past, Ethan and Katie held out the zucchetto, attempting to get his attention. Just after he had passed by them, he heard them calling out
    for him and instructed his driver to stop. A security guard walked over to Ethan and Katie and took the zucchetto, which he proceeded to give to Pope Francis. The Holy Father checked the size,
    read the note, smiled, took off the one he was wearing, and placed theirs on his head. He gave the one that he had been wearing to the security guard, who in turn gave it to Ethan and
    Katie.

     

    “The best part of the whole encounter was just seeing Pope Francis smile at us. He radiates joy in a way unlike anyone else,” said Katie.

        No Christ Without the Cross - The Torch BC

            No Christ Without the Cross        

Hertenstein · Blog · Nov2013

    by Mark Hertenstein

    Mark is a Senior Staff Columnist; he writes our monthly "Protestant Perspective" column.

     

    One of the things I detest the most is hearing from Christians that “God meets me where I am.” To quote Joel Osteen, who builds entire sermons and a corporate message of health-wealth gospel in
    his books (not unlike the indulgence sellers of old), “You are accepted by God.” Yes, he confirmed that he means everyone in a later interview.

    Now I am not about to say God doesn’t love everyone. That would be bad theology and contrary to the Christian message. Rather what often lies behind statements like those above is an amorphous
    sense of sin as something that maybe happens from time to time, of a God who just ignores it, of a Christ without the cross.

     

    That is a cop-out. It is a false sense of security, an ignorance of fact. If one proclaims himself a Christian, statements such as this negate any sense of why Christ and the cross are important.
    If the central moment of all of history is that event, but one waters down the reason why (answer: our sinfulness), what is the point exactly?

     

    What it comes down to is the fact that we will all admit that we do wrong, we sin, but we refuse to see our own sinfulness and our need for the cross. Therein lies the idea that we are accepted.
    Without sin, God only lifts up, and thus God is merely a grandfatherly figure who chuckles and simply picks up his grandchild and accepts him or her with ignorance to any wrong, because that can
    be ignored, and Jesus was a man who was a messenger of that grandfatherly God who wants us all to get along and tells us “imagine all the people living life in peace.”

     

    On the contrary, we proclaim that through the Law comes knowledge of sin, and the Law, the requirement of God and His righteousness, shows that sin is not merely something that can be ignored –
    sin is an injury to the relationship between God and man and between man and his fellow man. There is no ignoring that if God is to remain righteous, and that means total separation from God’s
    infinite righteous nature.

     

    Through knowledge of the Law then comes despair, the death of our selves because when faced with the requirement of God we realize we cannot possibly fulfill it. We are nothing in His sight if we
    are sinners. That is the powerful realization that this world so often wants us to forget, for the greatest triumph of the devil, the embodiment of all evil, is to convince us that evil doesn’t
    exist.

     

    For Christians, with the realization of sin comes also the realization of God’s love. In other words, only those who fully know their sin can truly understand and accept the gracious gift of
    Christ that God gave for all mankind. The very notion that God should dwell among us as a man is grave and powerful with the idea that we are sinful. God still loves us enough to condescend to
    us, but not merely to make everything OK, to declare all that we do to be just fine. He does not declare a sinner a saint, but truly makes him so.

     

    In God’s “No” is God’s “Yes.” In God’s rejection of sin by laying it all on Christ to be atoned for, God recreates and accepts humanity now cleansed of sin through the perseverance of Christ on
    the cross. Only in this context can the grace of God make sense because in that sinless state is man’s real value, man’s real goodness. It was only the knowledge of sin and cross, and then grace,
    that sets the saints apart from the rest. They did not live an extraordinarily good life just because; they did so because they rejoiced in the grace of God and because they were now new people
    who could participate in divine life in faith in Christ. This grace is given free of our own works, though we are called to act accordingly because it changes us. We are called to be what we have
    been re-created to be by God.

     

    Luther explains this whole idea as being God’s left and right hands. With His left hand, he puts down man, that is, man’s false notion of himself, such that man sees his nothingness as it is.
    With His right hand He lifts man up in Christ. It is in this sense that we should understand Christ “seated at the right hand of the Father.” Realization of sin, confession of sin, and a dose of
    despair of our own means of solving our problem is healthy for our faith because we are confronted with reality, our sin, and we may then properly be crucified with Christ so that we might live
    in Him (to paraphrase St. Paul in his Letter to the Galatians).

     

    A lack of acknowledgement of sin waters down our message. It removes the necessity of Christ. It does not allow us to be changed in Christ.

     

    But there can be no Christ without the cross.

     

    Dietrich Bonhoeffer called this “cheap grace.” In one of the most famous passages of his classic Discipleship, indeed one of the most famous passages of theology from the last century, he says:

     

    Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without the living, incarnate Jesus Christ…[Costly grace] is costly, because it calls to discipleship; it is grace,
    because it calls us to follow Jesus Christ. It is costly, because it costs people their lives; it is grace, because it thereby makes them live. It is costly, because it condemns sin; it is grace,
    because it justifies the sinner…Grace is costly, because it forces people under the yoke of Jesus Christ; it is grace, when Jesus says, ‘My yoke is easy, and my burden light.’

     

    Have you been to confession lately? Have you prayed in repentance, in contrition to a God whom you have no right to approach? Have you examined your conscience before God rather than before
    yourself?

     

    If you have not, then I encourage you to do so. Only then can the unapproachable God approach you, change you, put the old Adam to death so that you might then live in Christ. In confession, in
    condemnation of sin, God still pierces through and rescues us, loves us, if only we had eyes to see and ears to hear.

            Please Consider Donating to the Military Archdiocese        

Mack · Blog · Nov2013

    by Ethan Mack

    Ethan is Executive Editor and a Senior Staff Columnist.

     

    This Sunday, November 10, there will be a national collection held for the Archdiocese for the Military Services. The Archdiocese for the Military Services (AMS) is a Catholic diocese established
    in 1985 by Pope John Paul II. Its mission is to tend to the pastoral needs of Catholic men and women in the military and provide them with the sacraments. AMS sponsors all Catholic chaplains in
    the military and aids them in providing these essential services to those in uniform throughout the world.

    In their general meeting last year, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) decided to hold a national collection to benefit AMS. This was decided because unlike every other
    diocese in the country, AMS can't hold annual appeals or collections since it has no parishes. Also, despite common misconceptions, AMS doesn’t receive a penny from the U.S.
    government and relies completely on private donations in order to continually function

     

    I've heard many Catholics tell me that we should not support AMS because its existence is counter to Catholic teaching on peace. As someone who spent last summer working at the Archdiocese, I can
    tell you that nothing is further from the truth. AMS isn't about supporting war; it simply works to support those who fight in them. My time there was spent in the office for evangelization, and
    I spent most of my time working on youth ministry programs for youths living on military bases. Never once did I feel I was working for a pro-war organization. In fact, the only time I was tasked
    with writing anything about the ethics of war is when Archbishop Timothy Broglio (BC ’73) asked me to write something concerning Catholic teaching on peace for the Archdiocese's website.

     

    The Archdiocese for the Military Services truly performs a vital service for both our soldiers and our country. This is why I would strongly recommend that you consider donating something to the
    AMS collection this Sunday.

        The Protestant Perspective on Lumen Fidei - The Torch BC

            The Protestant Perspective on Lumen Fidei        

Hertenstein · Oct2013 · Blog

    by Mark Hertenstein

    Mark is a Senior Staff Columnist; he writes our monthly "Protestant Perspective" column.

     

    As a Protestant, and especially as a Lutheran, I was excited about the prospect of an encyclical from the papacy on faith. Part of me wanted to see what the papacy, after centuries of dogging the
    Reformers, would say on the Reformers’ primary concern, and indeed if it would reflect what Martin Luther had said all along. Part of me cringed for fear that should it not be done properly
    (read: the pope goes against current thought and scholarship about the issue of faith on both sides), it would perpetuate a division that should not exist between the two sides.

    I was rather impressed, enough to give my own praise for the substance of the document, even if I have reservations about the style or manner in which it is presented. I say style, for Pope
    Emeritus Benedict XVI spoke against Luther on a couple of occasions, including Spe Salvi, but in fact used formulae of doctrine or interpretation that are in total congruity with Luther’s
    teachings. The manner of trying to distinguish oneself overshadowed the unity between the two. That said, this is my mostly positive assessment of those aspects that are relevant to such
    discussion.

     

    Pope Francis notes that faith is first and foremost the gift of God, and only the gift of God (sola gratia). There is nothing which man contributes to the gift of faith, insofar as it is a divine
    gift through grace, the Word which God has spoken to man in Jesus Christ, though this does not overshadow the fact that in faith we may then live in Christ. Faith, therefore, in terms of order,
    precedes all other things, for it provides the basis for hope and charity. This is the programmatic statement of the encyclical.

     

    His Holiness goes on to describe the Biblical witness to faith with that basis in the first section. Faith for Abraham and Israel means that faith facilitates the divine-human encounter, the
    “I-Thou” relationship, the idea that encounter between two beings who recognize each other as beings creates the true idea of relationship. Further, in St. Paul, faith is the means by which man
    receives his new being in Christ. This is to say, man is made whole, justified, and made new only in Christ, and only through faith. If I were to put this in Reformation terminology, solo Christo
    and sola fide. It is then the renewal, the re-creation, in Christ through faith which then brings about good works. On the basis of the Biblical witness, Francis emphasizes that works have no
    role in this re-creation in Christ and that it is solely by faith. Coincidentally, this echoes Luther’s idea on the matter in The Freedom of the Christian. Yes works are necessary and part of the
    life of faith, but faith and the renewal that come from it precede all else, thus the work of God precedes all else. This faith and renewal then takes shape in the Church, the body of Christ.

     

    The third section deals with the Church as the community of faith. The Church is the community of faith and it facilitates the passing on of faith through Word and Sacrament. It is not just the
    relation of the autonomous subject to God. In fact, it is better to speak of God as the subject who imparts faith to man as the object through grace. Faith also occurs in community, and it is
    unifying and uniting because it makes us one in Christ, in whom we now live. This also is in accord with the Reformers, particularly Martin Luther.

     

    Now certainly there are things that I can quarrel over. Namely, to end an encyclical on faith that has hitherto emphasized Christ, it seems strange to address a prayer to Mary asking for help in
    receiving the Word and faith in Christ, which was previously described as coming only from God (perhaps this is a sign of the two popes writing one document). Further is the issue of it being a
    prayer to Mary falls into the problem of having a key distinction, that between prayer to God and asking for the prayers of the saints, lost in the transition from those who know better to the
    masses who are not always on that same page, creating false popular notions.

     

    But I can live with ambiguity at the end of the encyclical. That small portion means little compared to the important substance of the body of the text, a text that undoubtedly shows me that
    Martin Luther’s Reformation is visibly accomplishing its task.

    Archbishop Tobin Reflects on the Church as Communion

    by Allison R. Shely

     

    On Monday, March 24, the Church in the 21st Century Center hosted Archbishop Joseph Tobin of Indianapolis in the Heights Room as part of its “Our Episcopal Visitor” series. This lecture series
    seeks to invite one or two bishops to campus each year for Boston College to share its way of living out its Jesuit mission and to learn from the bishops how it can be of greater service to the
    Church.

     

    Archbishop Tobin, whose father played on the BC football team in the 1940s while a student here, met with Father Leahy and members of the theology department. His day concluded with this talk,
    entitled “Church-Communion: Roles in Relationship,” in keeping with C21’s spring theme of “Intimacy and Relationships.”

    MA Bishops Push for a Just Minimum Wage Increase

    by Gjergji Evangjeli

     

    The Bishops of Massachusetts released a statement on March 19th that highlighted the necessity of the State legislature to carefully consider the struggles of workers who are earning minimum
    wage. This statement from the College of Bishops of Massachusetts comes at the same time that as many as three different pieces of legislation are being entertained by the State Government. The
    Senate recently passed a bill increasing the minimum wage to $11 by 2016 and another overhauling the unemployment insurance system. The House is introducing another piece of legislation that
    seeks to increase the minimum wage to $10.50 by 2016. House Speaker Robert DeLeo said on Thursday that he hopes the finalized House bill will take into consideration the increased burden that
    such a hike would take on business owners and argued that this measure could be passed only in conjunction with reform in the unemployment insurance sector and that he hoped to combine the two
    bills from the Senate into a single system.

    Professor Kerry Cronin gave her famous dating talk called “Bring Back the Date” on February 10 at an event sponsored by the St. Thomas More Society. The next night, she gave a follow-up talk
    called “Making the Move: Navigating Dating Transitions,” which was sponsored by the Church in the 21st Century. Cronin criticized the hookup culture at BC, challenged the students to go on a
    date, and spoke about the values that are important in decision-making in relationships.

    UN Report on Child Sexual Abuse within the Vatican Sparks Backlash

    by Sofia Infante

     

    A United Nations Committee Report released by the UN Committee for the Rights of Child has ignited a firestorm of criticism from Catholic Church officials and leaders who accuse it of
    manipulating the child sex scandal to impose secular views and change Church doctrine, while ignoring the Church’s advancements in the area of child protection. The report, released on February
    5, called for the Vatican to open its files to public review, enforce mandatory reporting to law enforcement officials, stating, “[The Vatican] has adopted policies and practices which have led
    to the continuation of the abuse by and the impunity of the perpetrators.” The report also made recommendations concerning the Church’s views on same-sex marriage, contraception, and abortion.

    Kerry Visits Vatican To Discuss Syria, Obamacare

    by Elinor Mitchell

     

    Early this month, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with his Vatican counterpart, Pietro Parolin, to discuss conflict in Middle East and the implications of
    the new nationalized healthcare, among other things. Father Federico Lomardi, a Vatican spokesman, said the meeting was broad and confirmed that Kerry and Parolin, along with aides, spoke
    specifically about the suffering in Syria and Sudan. Pope Francis and the Vatican have been outspoken proponents of peace in Syria in an effort to protect human rights. The talk came only weeks
    before the U.N. sponsored peace talks scheduled for January 22nd in Geneva. The conference will hopefully help resolve the rights issues in Syria. Kerry and Parolin also addressed a similar
    situation in South Sudan. According to the U.N., conflict in South Sudan has left 10,000 dead and another 355,000 displaced.

    Viaggio a Roma: Why are you a Catholic?

    by Katie Rich

     

    Walking through the muddy barracks of Auschwitz, seeing the vile latrines and the ruins of the gas chambers used to murder a million innocent people, the existence of evil was tangible, its
    fossils decaying right before my eyes. The ashes from the ground seemed to whisper, why are you a Catholic?

     

    Every day, our phones and televisions and computer screens awaken our minds to the wretched reality of the world. A massive typhoon kills thousands in a country that has a hard enough time
    standing on its own two feet. Another shooting has happened in another shopping mall or elementary school, while cheeks are still damp with tears from the last horrific outburst. Planes crash,
    ships sink, people die. Chaos spits angrily in our faces, why are you a Catholic?

    Pro-Abortion Protests in Buenos Aires Turn Violent; Attempt to Vandalize Cathedral

    by Gjergji Evangjeli

     

    Violent outbreaks and inflammatory statements marked this year’s Gathering of Women on November 24 in Argentina. According to InfoCatolica and LifeSiteNews.com, the conflict started earlier in
    the day, while the different workshops of the meeting were still in session. Eye-witness accounts report that in workshops related to the topic of abortion, several fundamentalist groups of
    pro-abortion feminists blocked access to anyone that did not espouse their views. There were several reports of physical violence reported by opponents of abortion who sought to engage in
    discussion regarding the topic.

    Suspicious Fires Damage Theology Department, Gasson Hall

    by Chris Canniff and Natalie Yuhas

     

    On Saturday, November 9, at approximately 9:45pm, Boston College police received reports of small fires in Gasson and Stokes halls. Two of the fires had been set in the north wing of Stokes Hall,
    and another fire was set in Gasson 100 (the Irish Room) in Gasson Hall. The fourth floor of Stokes North, where the most serious damage was reported, is home to the theology department.

     

    The school’s emergency alert system notified students of the fires at 2:10am on Sunday morning via text message and email alerts. Students were told to be wary of suspicious activity and to leave
    their building immediately if a fire alarm were to sound.

    Most Rev. Joseph E. Kurtz becomes President of USCCB

        Archbishop Kurtz

    by Jay Chin

     

    The Archbishop of Louisville, Kentucky, Joseph E. Kurtz, has been chosen to succeed Timothy Cardinal Dolan as President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The election was held
    at their General Assembly, which ran from November 11-14 in Baltimore. He ran against nine other nominees for the position and won 53% of the vote (125 votes). The second largest amount of votes
    were for Daniel Cardinal DiNardo of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Huston, Texas, with 10% (25 votes). DiNardo was soon after elected Vice President in the third round of voting, garnering 63% of
    the votes (147 votes) against Philadelphia’s Archbishop Charles Chaput’s 37% (87 votes).

    The Superior General of the Jesuits Visits the US

    by Gjergji Evangjeli

     

    Very Rev. Adolfo Nicolás, S.J., Superior General of the Society of Jesus, concluded a two-week visit to the US on October 12. He had a packed schedule as he moved through Boston, New York, St.
    Lewis, and Chicago where he engaged in many activities, including attending a meeting with the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.

     

    Fr. Nicolás’ visit began in Boston, where he met with faculty members of the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry. He told students and seminarians that the Church needs Jesuits who are
    men of great intellectual depth. He also reminded them that, when being called to the Society of Jesus, they are being called to join a universal vocation. “To be available in a universal way,”
    he said, “calls for us to be creative, and to be creative we need to be men of prayer.” While in Boston, Fr. Nicolás met with 55 Jesuit scholastics from 20 different countries.

    Saint of the Issue: Maximilian Kolbe

    by Chris Canniff

     

    Saint Maximilian Kolbe was born Raymund Kolbe on January 8, 1894 in a small town in central Poland, which was part of the Russian Empire at the time.

     

    Kolbe experienced a vision of the Blessed Mother during his childhood, which he later described as follows: “That night, I asked the Mother of God what was to become of me, a Child of Faith. Then
    she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red
    that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.”

    Father Scott Brodeur Discusses St. Paul’s Teachings on Charisms

    by Allison R. Shely

     

    On Thursday, April 10, Father Scott Brodeur, S.J., a professor at the Gregorian University in Rome, gave a lecture entitled “What St. Paul Teaches Us About Charisms.” Held in the Heights Room, the talk was co-sponsored by the Center for Ignatian Spirituality, the Roche Center for Catholic Education, and the School of Theology and Ministry. In the
    beginning, Father Brodeur admitted that a “formidable topic” was at hand. First, he defined some terms and presented their etymological background. The Greek chárisma appears 17 times in the New
    Testament: 16 in Paul’s letters and once in First Peter. Deriving from cháris, grace, chárisma means “something given out of generosity” or “gracious gift,” which is Father Brodeur’s preferred
    translation. The New American Bible translates chárisma as “a gift” and other translations render it as “a free gift,” but Father Brodeur called this problematic, for the term cannot apply to
    gifts given by humans to humans and “clearly [refers to] a divine activity.” Moreover, natural talents and fortunate circumstances are natural, not spiritual gifts.

    Theology and Ministry Library Exhibits Pre-Vatican II Pamphlets and Religious Articles

    by Margaret Antonio

     

    In 1978, William J. Leonard, a Jesuit theology professor at Boston College, began collecting thousands of pamphlets and religious articles about Catholic teaching, liturgy, and lifestyle before
    the introduction of the Second Vatican Council’s reforms. Fr. Leonard realized that the “implementation of Vatican II reforms would result in an overhaul of the literature and material culture of
    Catholic religious life.” His collections began the Liturgy & Life Collection at the John J. Burns Library.

    Archbishop Tobin Reflects on the Church as Communion

    by Allison R. Shely

     

    On Monday, March 24, the Church in the 21st Century Center hosted Archbishop Joseph Tobin of Indianapolis in the Heights Room as part of its “Our Episcopal Visitor” series. This lecture series
    seeks to invite one or two bishops to campus each year for Boston College to share its way of living out its Jesuit mission and to learn from the bishops how it can be of greater service to the
    Church.

     

    Archbishop Tobin, whose father played on the BC football team in the 1940s while a student here, met with Father Leahy and members of the theology department. His day concluded with this talk,
    entitled “Church-Communion: Roles in Relationship,” in keeping with C21’s spring theme of “Intimacy and Relationships.”

    Bridging the Gap Between Faith and Reason

        Boston College Professor Sarah Byers' book Perception, Sensitivity, and Moral Motivation in Augustine addresses the modern controversey about grace, free will, and the intellect

    by Margaret Antonio

     

    “My early education in Theology effectively came to a stop in 6th grade – after that, the classes just repeated that there are seven sacraments,” said Professor Sarah Byers. For many people, the
    seemingly routine memorization of prayers, rattling off the seven sacraments, and listing the three Persons of the Trinity in Sunday school result in their leaving the faith or partitioning it
    off in favor of “higher” intellectual pursuits. However, for Sarah Byers, a professor of philosophy at Boston College, studying philosophy helped her bridge this gap between faith and reason in
    her own life.

     

    Studying Augustine “was the first time I realized there was such a thing as high-level intellectual Christianity,” said Byers. Professor Byers’ interest in philosophy began at a young age, when
    at the dinner table her father took part in her intellectual development by challenging her about political ideas or ethical issues in which she was interested. When Byers took a philosophy core
    class as a freshman at the Jesuit St. Joseph’s University, she realized that those conversations with her father were at the heart of “philosophy,” which she eventually declared as her
    undergraduate major. Later, during her graduate studies, Byers’ studies on Augustine presented her with “the idea that early Christian philosophy was asking interesting questions in ethics
    and metaphysics, and that it was a development from ancient philosophy.”
